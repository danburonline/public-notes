Normative sciences aim to evaluate or prescribe what *ought* to be done, relying on preferred standards or ideals, whereas non-normative (or descriptive) sciences investigate what *is* the case without making value judgements. Commonly identified normative sciences include ethics, aesthetics, and certain branches of philosophy that make evaluative claims about actions, values, or states of affairs. In contrast, non-normative fields like physics or biology focus on empirical, factual observations that describe phenomena as they occur in nature.

**Key Distinctions**  
- Normative sciences judge or prescribe based on a set of norms.  
- Descriptive sciences measure, describe, and explain objective occurrences.  
- Both can intersect in fields like philosophy, where empirical methods inform ethical or evaluative discussions.

## Interplay Between Art and Science

Art and science share overlapping goals: they both strive to explore the world, stimulate curiosity, and communicate insights about reality, though their methods differ in emphasis. Art often expresses subjective interpretations through creativity and aesthetics, while science uses systematic experimentation and observation. Nevertheless, each field can illuminate the other, such as when artists visually interpret scientific data or when scientists harness artistic creativity to inspire novel experimental designs.

**Similar Goals**  
- Understanding the world through imaginative representation (art) and rigorous testing (science).  
- A shared quest for originality and insight.  
- Enhancement of society by fostering deeper ways of seeing and engaging with reality.

## The Omnipresence of Logic

Logic underpins how we draw valid conclusions from given premises and helps define consistent methods of inquiry in every discipline. As a formal and universal tool, it tests whether statements follow coherently, remaining topic-neutral: it does not depend on whether the subject matter is scientific, ethical, or aesthetic. By articulating how assertions relate to each other, logic clarifies how knowledge claims can be structured and evaluated in all fields of research.

**Applications**  
- Ensuring valid argumentation in mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and philosophy.  
- Providing a consistent framework for evaluating scientific hypotheses.  
- Enhancing clarity in debates about normative matters like ethics and aesthetics.
