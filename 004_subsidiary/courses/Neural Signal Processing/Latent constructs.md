A latent construct, also known as a latent variable or hidden variable, is **a variable that is not directly observed but inferred from other observed or measured variables.** [[Latent space|Latent]] constructs are often used in psychological testing and other areas of research where certain phenomena cannot be directly observed.

> [!example] Examples
> - **Intelligence**: It is a latent construct because it cannot be directly observed or measured but is inferred from variables that can be measured, such as scores on intelligence tests, academic performance, etc.
> - **[[Activity-dependent plasticity#Long-Term Depression (LTD)|Depression]]:** Similarly, depression is a latent construct inferred from symptoms such as persistent sadness, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, etc.
> - **Customer satisfaction**: In business research, customer satisfaction is a common latent construct. It is often measured using several different indicators, such as survey responses to questions about product quality, service quality, and overall satisfaction.

## Measurement

Latent constructs are typically measured through multiple indicators. These indicators are observable variables believed to “tap into” the latent construct. For example, a researcher might measure the latent construct of depression through several observable indicators, such as self-reported mood, sleep patterns, and appetite.

## Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

Structural equation modelling is a statistical technique often used to analyse the relationships between latent constructs. SEM allows researchers to test complex theoretical models that include multiple latent constructs and the paths between them.

## Importance

Latent constructs are important in many fields of study, particularly in social sciences, as they allow researchers to study abstract concepts that cannot be directly observed or measured. Researchers can gain a deeper understanding of complex phenomena by inferring the existence and influence of these constructs through observable indicators.

> [!warning] Challenges
While latent constructs provide a valuable tool for research, they also pose challenges. The main challenge is in accurately identifying and measuring the latent construct. Misidentification or poor measurement can lead to inaccurate results and interpretations. Additionally, latent constructs are often subject to ongoing debate and refinement as our understanding of them evolves.
