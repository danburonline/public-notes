The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two major nervous system divisions. It is composed of **all the nerves that branch off from the brain and spinal cord** ([Central nervous system](../../../../003_education/kings%20college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Central%20nervous%20system.md)).

## Structure

### Somatic Nervous System

- Responsible for voluntary movement of skeletal muscles.
- Contains both sensory and motor neurons.
- Sensory neurons transmit signals from the body to the CNS.
- Motor neurons transmit signals from the CNS to the body.

### Autonomic Nervous System

- Controls involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal.
- Divided into the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

#### Sympathetic Nervous System

  - Primarily involved in the body’s “fight or flight” response.

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System

  - Promotes “rest and digest” or “feed and breed” responses.

### Enteric Nervous System

- Also known as the “second brain,” it controls the gastrointestinal system.

## Sensations

The peripheral nervous system plays a key role in transmitting sensory information to the [Central nervous system](../../../../003_education/kings%20college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Central%20nervous%20system.md). It handles both special and general sensations.

### Special Sensations

- Special sensations are those that have specific organs devoted to them, such as vision (eyes), hearing and balance (ears), taste (tongue), and smell (nose).

### General Sensations

- General sensations are those that are felt throughout the body, such as temperature, pain, touch, pressure, vibration, and [Proprioception](Proprioception.md) (body position).

## Functions

- Connects the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body, enabling communication.
- Regulates and controls body functions and sensations.

## Diseases and Disorders

- Neuropathy
- Guillain-Barré Syndrome
- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
- Bell’s Palsy
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease
