Data in data science can be categorised into several types based on their nature and characteristics. Here are four common types of data:
 1. **Numeric Data:** Numeric data consists of continuous numerical values and can be further categorised as discrete or continuous. Discrete numeric data consists of whole numbers and has limited possible values. For example, the number of siblings a person has is discrete numeric data. Continuous numeric data, on the other hand, includes real numbers and can take on any value within a range. *An example of continuous numeric data is the height of a person.*
2. **Discrete Data:** Discrete data represents separate, distinct values that cannot be divided into smaller units. It usually consists of whole numbers or counts. *For instance, the number of cars in a parking lot is discrete data because it cannot take on fractional or continuous values.*
3. **Categorical Data:** Categorical data represents different categories or groups. It consists of qualitative values and can be further divided into nominal and ordinal data. Nominal categorical data has no inherent order or ranking between categories. *An example of nominal categorical data is the colours of cars, where the categories are red, blue, green, etc.*
4. **Ordinal Data:** Ordinal data also represents categories but with a specific order or ranking. The categories have a relative position or rank but may not have a consistent numerical difference between them. *A typical example of ordinal data is the ratings given to a movie (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, etc.).*
