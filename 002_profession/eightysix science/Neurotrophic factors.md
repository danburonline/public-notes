Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are **specialised biomolecules, primarily peptides and small proteins, that support neuronal growth, survival, and differentiation** in both developing and mature neurons.

## Key Families

- **Neurotrophins**: Including NGF, BDNF, NT-3
- **GFLs**: Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor family
- **Neuropoietic [[Cytokines]]**: Including CNTF

## Signalling Mechanisms

- **Primary Pathway**: Tyrosine kinase receptor signalling
- **Secondary Pathway**: p75 receptor-mediated processes
- **Cellular Response**: Promotes survival, plasticity, and memory formation

## Delivery Strategies

- **Direct Administration**: ICV or local injection
- **Cell-Based**: MSCs expressing NTFs
- **Biomaterial-Based**: Controlled release scaffolds
- **Viral Vectors**: Gene therapy approaches
