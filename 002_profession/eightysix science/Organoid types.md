Organoids are miniature, three-dimensional structures grown in vitro that **mimic the architecture and function of real organs**. They are derived from stem cells and classified based on the tissue lineage from which they originate. Below is a categorised overview for study purposes:

## 1. Ectodermal Organoids

- **Primary Focus:** Brain, retina, and skin.
- **Applications:**
  - **Cerebral Organoids:**
    - Used for modelling neurological conditions, such as:
      - **Zika virus infection**
      - **Microcephaly**
  - **Brain Assembloids:**
    - Advanced organoid forms where multiple brain region organoids are fused.
    - Purpose: Study **neural circuit interactions**.

## 2. Mesodermal Organoids

- **Primary Focus:** Kidney, heart, and blood vessels.
- **Applications:**
  - Significant for **cardiovascular and renal disease modelling**.
  - **Kidney Organoids:**
    - Study **nephrotoxicity** in drug testing.
  - **Heart Organoids:**
    - Model **cardiotoxicity** and study cardiac diseases.
  - **Blood Vessel Organoids:**
    - Research vascular disease mechanisms.

## 3. Endodermal Organoids

- **Primary Focus:** Lungs, liver, and intestines.
- **Applications:**
  - **Lung Organoids:**
    - Model respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.
  - **Liver Organoids:**
    - Study liver-related diseases and drug metabolism.
  - **Intestinal Organoids:**
    - Test gastrointestinal drug efficacy.
