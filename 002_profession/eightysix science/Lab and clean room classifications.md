## Cleanroom Classifications

### ISO Standards (ISO 14644-1)

The primary modern classification system ranges from ISO 1 (cleanest) to ISO 9 (least clean). Here are the key classes:

#### ISO Class 3-4

- Used for semiconductor manufacturing
- Extremely strict particle control
- Up to 1,000-10,000 particles (≥0.1 μm) per cubic meter

#### ISO Class 5

- Medical grade for implants and sterile pharmaceuticals
- Common for cell culture and DNA/RNA work
- Up to 100,000 particles (≥0.1 μm) per cubic meter

#### ISO Class 7

- Standard for medical device manufacturing
- Electronics assembly
- PCB/SMT manufacturing
- Up to 352,000 particles (≥0.5 μm) per cubic meter

#### ISO Class 8

- Basic cleanroom environment
- Non-sterile pharmaceutical production
- Up to 3,520,000 particles (≥0.5 μm) per cubic meter

## Critical Requirements

### Air Control Systems

- HEPA/ULPA filtration systems
- Controlled airflow patterns
- Regular air changes (varying by class)

### Construction Requirements

- Smooth, impervious surfaces
- Non-shedding materials
- Coved corners
- Sealed joints
- Special lighting fixtures

## Medical Grade Standards

### GMP Classifications

For medical and pharmaceutical applications:

| Grade | Use Case | Particle Limit (In Operation) |
|-------|----------|------------------------------|
| A     | Critical zones | 3,520 particles/m³ |
| B     | Aseptic preparation | 352,000 particles/m³ |
| C     | Less critical areas | 3,520,000 particles/m³ |
| D     | Background environment | Not defined |

## Monitoring and Certification

### Key Parameters

- Particle count measurements
- Room recovery rate
- Air pressure differentials
- Temperature and humidity control

### Testing Frequency

- Particle count: Every 6-12 months
- Airflow verification: Every 12 months
- Pressure differential monitoring: Continuous

## Mathematical Classification

The ISO classification is determined by the following formula:

$$ C_N = 10^N \left(\frac{0.1}{D}\right)^{2.08} $$

Where:
- $C_N$ = maximum permitted concentration of particles
- $N$ = ISO classification number
- $D$ = particle size in μm
