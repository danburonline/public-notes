## What is GMP?

- GMP = **G**ood **M**anufacturing **P**ractice
- Regulatory requirements to ensure consistent quality and safety of medical products
- Covers all aspects of production: materials, facilities, equipment, training, hygiene

## Key GMP Considerations for 3D Bioprinted Neural Tissue

- **Sterile environment** - Clean room facilities to prevent contamination
- **Quality control** - Rigorous testing of materials and final product
- **Standardised processes** - Validated, reproducible bioprinting protocols
- **Traceability** - Documentation of all steps and materials used
- **Qualified personnel** - Trained staff following standard operating procedures

## Challenges for Neural Tissue Grafts

- Complexity of neural tissue structure and function
- Maintaining cell viability during printing process
- Achieving consistent cellular composition and organisation
- Scaling up production while maintaining quality
- Meeting regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy
