Cell confluence refers to the **percentage of surface area covered by adherent cells in a culture dish** or flask, representing how densely packed cells are in the growth environment.

## Measurement Levels

| Confluence Level | Description                              | Typical Use                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Low (20-30%)     | Sparse cell coverage, ample growth space | Initial seeding, expansion |
| Medium (50%)     | Half surface coverage                    | Experimental procedures    |
| High (80-100%)   | Dense cell coverage                      | Harvesting, subculturing   |

## Monitoring Methods

1. **Visual Estimation**
   - Microscopic observation
   - Rule of thumb comparison
   - Quick assessment

2. **Quantitative Analysis**
   - Automated imaging systems
   - AI-based applications
   - Impedance-based monitoring
