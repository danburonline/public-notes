Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are **specialised biomolecules, primarily peptides and small proteins, that support neuronal growth, survival, and differentiation** in both developing and mature neurons.

## Key Families

- **Neurotrophins**: Including NGF, BDNF, NT-3
- **GFLs**: Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor family
- **Neuropoietic [Cytokines](../../003_education/kings-college/08%20Advances%20in%20Neuroscience/Cytokines.md)**: Including CNTF

## Signalling Mechanisms

- **Primary Pathway**: Tyrosine kinase receptor signalling
- **Secondary Pathway**: p75 receptor-mediated processes
- **Cellular Response**: Promotes survival, plasticity, and memory formation

## Delivery Strategies

- **Direct Administration**: ICV or local injection
- **Cell-Based**: MSCs expressing NTFs
- **Biomaterial-Based**: Controlled release scaffolds
- **Viral Vectors**: Gene therapy approaches

> [!example] Neurotrophic factors in neural tissue engineering (biomaterial-based)
> Use case: Repairing a peripheral nerve gap with a BDNF-releasing conduit.
> 
> - Objective: Promote axonal regrowth and survival across a 10–15 mm nerve gap.
> - NTF choice: BDNF (± NGF) from the [Neurotrophic factors](Neurotrophic%20factors.md) family to enhance neurite extension, survival, and [synaptic plasticity](../../003_education/kings-college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Synaptic%20plasticity.md) via Trk signalling.
> - Scaffold: Aligned electrospun PCL/PLGA fibre conduit with a heparinised gelatin hydrogel core for controlled release.
> - Delivery strategy: Biomaterial-based sustained release (zero-order target ~2–4 weeks) matched to early regenerative phases; optional gradient (proximal→distal) to guide directionality.
> - Optional augmentations: 
>   - Cell-based: MSCs engineered to secrete NTFs for paracrine support.
>   - Electrical stimulation to synergise with NTF-driven plasticity.
> - Readouts: Increased neurite length and myelinated fibre count, reduced [apoptosis](../../003_education/kings-college/08%20Advances%20in%20Neuroscience/Apoptosis.md), improved functional indices (e.g., SFI), and enhanced reinnervation of target muscle.
> - Practical notes: Validate retained bioactivity post-encapsulation, tune loading (e.g., tens–hundreds ng/mL range) and release kinetics, and avoid burst release that can downregulate receptor sensitivity.
