Strangling microservices refers to **a strategy of gradually migrating a monolithic system to a microservices architecture.** It involves selectively replacing or re-implementing parts of the monolithic system with independent microservices over time. The term “strangling” implies that the microservices gradually take over the functionality of the monolithic system until it is fully decomposed.

The main idea behind this approach is to **avoid a complete system rewrite by incrementally introducing microservices and minimising disruption** to the existing functionality. It allows organizations to leverage the benefits of microservices, such as scalability, agility, and independent deployment, while minimising risks and costs associated with a large-scale system overhaul.
