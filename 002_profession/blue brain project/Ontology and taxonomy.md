## Ontology

- **Definition**: Ontology is the study of being and existence, focusing on the most general features of reality. In philosophy, it explores the nature of entities and their categorisation.
- **Purpose**: In computer science, an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation, used to define meaning and structure knowledge in a domain.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Formal and machine-readable.
  - Captures complex relationships between entities.
  - Used for semantic data integration and knowledge management.

## Taxonomy

- **Definition**: Taxonomy is the science of classification, particularly in biology, where it involves naming, describing, and grouping organisms based on shared characteristics.
- **Purpose**: It provides a hierarchical structure for organising entities, often based on morphological, behavioural, or genetic traits.
- **Key Features**:
  - Typically hierarchical.
  - Focuses on categorising entities into groups based on shared attributes.
  - Originated in library science and biology.

## Key Differences

- **Structure**: Taxonomies are generally hierarchical, while ontologies are more complex, often structured as semantic networks.
- **Relationships**: Ontologies describe more detailed relationships between entities, including non-hierarchical ones.
- **Application**: Taxonomies are commonly used in biology and information retrieval, whereas ontologies are crucial in computer science for knowledge management and semantic integration.
