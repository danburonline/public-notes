Boutons are **small swellings or protrusions at the terminal ends of axons** in neurons. The term comes from the French word for “buttons”.

## Function

- **Role in [[Types of synapses|Synapses]]**: Boutons are key components of synapses, the junctions where neurons communicate with each other or other cell types.
- **Containment of [[Neurotransmitters vs. neuromodulators vs. neuropeptides#Neurotransmitters|Neurotransmitters]]**: They contain synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, the chemicals used for neural communication.

## Mechanism

- **Action Potential Arrival**: When an action potential (an electrical signal) reaches a bouton, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters.
- **Transmission Process**: These neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft (the gap between neurons) and bind to receptors on the receiving neuron’s membrane.

## Importance

- **Signal Transmission**: Boutons are essential for the transmission of neural signals.
- **Role in Neural Processes**: They play a crucial role in various processes such as learning, memory, and overall brain and nervous system function.
