A point neuron is a **simplified mathematical model of a neuron,** which assumes that a neuron’s membrane potential can be represented as a single point in space. In this model, **the neuron’s input signals are represented as a sequence of electrical impulses or spikes,** and the neuron’s output signal is represented as a single spike that depends on the timing and frequency of the input spikes.
