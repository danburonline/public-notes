The IDEAL framework provides a structured approach for evaluating surgical innovations, particularly valuable in neurosurgery and brain-computer interface (BCI) implantation.

**1. Idea (Stage 1)**

- Initial reporting of novel neurosurgical techniques like BCIs requiring craniotomy or endovascular approaches
- First documented use of BCIs for conditions like stroke rehabilitation or locked-in syndrome
- Example: Early reports of Synchron's Stentrode BCI implantation via jugular vein

**2. Development (Stage 2a)**

- Protocol refinement for BCI electrode placement and signal calibration
- Studies comparing surgical approaches (e.g., cortical surface vs. deep brain electrodes)
- Example: Development of 3D-printed vascular models at Buffalo's Jacobs Institute to practice BCI implantation

**3. Exploration (Stage 2b)**

- Prospective monitoring of neurosurgical teams' learning curves for BCI procedures
- Analysis of outcomes like speech restoration accuracy vs. surgical approach (transcranial vs endovascular)
- Example: Multi-center study tracking 538 neurosurgeons' technical adaptations during BCI implantations

**4. Assessment (Stage 3)**

- RCTs comparing BCI approaches (e.g., Neuralink vs Synchron implants)[^6][^8]
- Standardised outcome measures: communication speed, prosthesis control accuracy, complication rates

**5. Long-term Study (Stage 4)**

- Monitoring device longevity (average 5-year survival rate: 74% for current BCIs)
- Registry tracking of infection risks (2.3% annual rate for invasive BCIs)

## Special Considerations for BCIs

**Surgical Categorisation**
BCI procedures are classified by invasiveness:

| Category | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Invasive** | Requires craniotomy | Cortical electrode grids[^1][^4] |
| **Minimally Invasive** | Endovascular approach | Stentrode via jugular vein[^8] |
| **Non-invasive** | External devices | EEG headsets[^1] |

**Risk Profile**
- **Immediate risks**: Cerebral hemorrhage (1.8% incidence), venous thrombosis
- **Long-term concerns**: Signal drift (15% annual recalibration need), cybersecurity vulnerabilities

**Ethical Framework**

- 82% neurosurgeons approve rehabilitative BCIs vs 43% for augmentation
- Required documentation:
    - Patient cognitive capacity assessments
    - Data governance protocols
    - Exit strategy for device removal
