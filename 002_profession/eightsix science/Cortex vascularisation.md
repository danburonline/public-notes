## Arterial Supply

- **Main sources**: Internal carotid arteries (anterior) and Vertebral arteries (posterior)
- **Circle of Willis**: Formed at the base of the brain
- **Major arteries**:
  1. Anterior cerebral arteries
  2. Middle cerebral arteries
  3. Posterior cerebral arteries

## Cortical Vascular Architecture

### Pial Vessels

- Location: Surface of brain within pia-arachnoid
- Form anastomotic network
- Give rise to penetrating arteries

### Penetrating Vessels

- Descend radially through cortical layers
- Located in Virchow-Robin space
- Transition: Pial â†’ Parenchymal arterioles

### Parenchymal Arterioles

- Surrounded by astrocytic end-feet
- Higher basal tone than pial arteries
- Form intrinsic microvascular compartment

## Microvascular Organisation

### Microvascular Lobules

- Structure: Central venule surrounded by arterioles
- Location: Superficial cortical layers

### Capillary Network

- Dense, lacy network around larger vessels
- Forms blood-brain barrier
- Adapts to neuronal needs (angiogenesis/reabsorption)

## Cortical Vascular Layers

1. Superficial layer (molecular)
2. Middle layer (Purkinje cell)
3. Deep layer (granular)

## Functional Aspects

- Pial vessels: Extrinsic innervation (peripheral nervous system)
- Parenchymal vessels: Intrinsic innervation (brain neuropil)
- Local control: Vascular sphincters regulate cortical perfusion
