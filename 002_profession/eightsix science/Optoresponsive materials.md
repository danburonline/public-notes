Optoresponsive materials are **substances that respond to light stimuli by changing their physical or chemical properties.** These materials are designed to react to specific wavelengths or intensities of light, often leading to applications in fields such as biomedicine, energy, and sensing technologies.

## Characteristics and Applications

- **Light Sensitivity**: Optoresponsive materials can undergo changes in shape, color, conductivity, or other properties when exposed to light. This sensitivity is typically achieved through photoactive molecules or structures that absorb light energy.
- **Biomedical Applications**: In biomedicine, optoresponsive materials are used in drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, and [[optogenetics]]. They can be designed to release drugs or modulate cellular behaviour in response to light.
- **Energy and Sensing**: Optoresponsive materials are also explored for energy harvesting and storage, as well as in sensors that detect environmental changes through light-induced responses.

## Examples of Optoresponsive Materials

- **Photoresponsive Polymers**: These materials change their shape or properties in response to light, often used in micro/nanomotors and actuators.
- **Optical Switches**: Materials that can switch between different states (e.g., conductive to insulating) upon light exposure, useful in optoelectronic devices.
- **Photoluminescent Materials**: Emit light in response to light absorption, used in displays and lighting applications.
