Invariant brain emulation refers to the **physical realisation of a mapping $f: B \rightarrow S$**, where $B \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the state space of a reference brain's dynamical system and $S \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the state space of an alternative physical substrate. For all observables $O$ (such as identity, cognitive function, or behaviour), the equivalence relation $O(f(b)) \equiv O(b)$ holds for every $b \in B$.

The invariance criterion requires that the mapping preserves the system's functional and dynamical properties under [[diffeomorphic transformation]], such that $\frac{\partial O}{\partial t} \big|_{f(b)} = \frac{\partial O}{\partial t} \big|_{b}$ for all relevant state trajectories. This formulation explicitly excludes computational abstractions, demanding strict physical realisability and operational equivalence through substrate-invariant functional isomorphism.

## Core Concepts

### Substrate Independence

The hypothesis that **mental states depend on functional organisation, not physical material**. If two systems implement the same functional relationships, they should produce identical cognitive outputs regardless of whether the substrate is biological neurons or silicon.

### Functional Isomorphism

Two systems are functionally isomorphic when there exists a **one-to-one mapping between their states** that preserves all causal relationships. This is stronger than behavioural equivalence—it requires internal state correspondence.

### Observable Equivalence

The practical test: for any measurement $O$ we can make (behaviour, reported experiences, physiological markers), the emulated system produces indistinguishable results from the original.

## Why "Invariant"?

The term emphasises that certain properties must remain **unchanged** (invariant) under the transformation:

- **Identity**: The emulated system is "the same person"
- **Cognitive function**: Memory, reasoning, perception preserved
- **Temporal dynamics**: Real-time processing maintained
- **Phenomenal experience**: Subjective experience (if it exists) transfers

## Challenges

### The Measurement Problem

Which observables $O$ must be preserved? Behaviour alone may be insufficient if we care about subjective experience.

### Granularity

At what level must functional equivalence hold?
- Synaptic? (molecular interactions)
- Neuronal? (spike patterns)
- Circuit? (population dynamics)
- Systems? (cognitive modules)

### Physical Realisability

The formulation demands **actual physical implementation**, not just simulation. A brain "running" on a classical computer may not satisfy the invariance criterion if timing or causal structure differs.

> [!warning] Open Question
> Whether invariant brain emulation preserves consciousness remains philosophically contested. Functionalists argue yes; biological naturalists argue the substrate itself matters.
