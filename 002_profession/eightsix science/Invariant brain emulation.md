**Invariant brain emulation refers to the physical realisation of a mapping $f: B \rightarrow S$, where $B \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the state space of a reference brain's dynamical system and $S \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the state space of an alternative physical substrate.** For all observables $O$ (such as identity, cognitive function, or behaviour), the equivalence relation $O(f(b)) \equiv O(b)$ holds for every $b \in B$.

The invariance criterion requires that the mapping preserves the system's functional and dynamical properties under [[diffeomorphic transformation]], such that $\frac{\partial O}{\partial t} \big|_{f(b)} = \frac{\partial O}{\partial t} \big|_{b}$ for all relevant state trajectories. This formulation explicitly excludes computational abstractions, demanding strict physical realisability and operational equivalence through substrate-invariant functional isomorphism.
