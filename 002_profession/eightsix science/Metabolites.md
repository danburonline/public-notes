Metabolites are **intermediate or end products of metabolism, typically small molecules that play crucial roles in cellular processes and tissue function.** They can be categorised into primary metabolites (essential for growth and development) and secondary metabolites (ecological functions).

## Types of Metabolites

### Primary Metabolites

- **Growth-Essential**: Directly involved in normal development and reproduction
- **Timing**: Produced during growth phase
- **Production**: Large quantities, easily extractable
- **Examples**:

  | Class | Examples |
  |-------|-----------|
  | Alcohols | Ethanol |
  | Amino Acids | Glutamic acid |
  | Organic Acids | Lactic acid |
  | Vitamins | B2 |

### Secondary Metabolites

- **Function**: Not directly involved in growth but important for ecological roles
- **Timing**: Produced during stationary phase
- **Production**: Small quantities, harder to extract
- **Examples**: Antibiotics, pigments, resins, terpenes

## Metabolic Functions

- **Energy Production**: ATP generation
- **Structural Components**: Cell building blocks
- **[[Neurotrophic factors#Signalling Mechanisms|Signalling]] Molecules**: Cell-cell communication
- **Regulatory Elements**: Enzyme modulation
- **Defense Mechanisms**: Protection against stressors
