The Thousand Brains Theory, developed by neuroscientist [Jeff Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins) and his team at Numenta, proposes that **human intelligence arises from the [[neocortex]]'s structure of approximately 150,000 cortical columns, each acting as an independent "mini-brain"** that builds complete models of the world through reference frames and sensorimotor predictions. These columns collaborate via voting mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and form coherent perceptions, challenging traditional views of centralised brain processing and offering insights for AI development.

## Key Concepts

- **Cortical Columns as Units**: Builds on the columnar hypothesis, which views cortical columns (vertical stacks of neurons in the [[neocortex]]) as the fundamental computational modules for processing sensory input and generating predictions. Hawkins extends this by hypothesising each column learns complete, location-based models independently.
- **Reference Frames and Voting**: Knowledge is encoded in spatial "maps" or reference frames within columns; long-range connections enable columns to "vote" on interpretations, integrating diverse sensory data for unified cognition.
- **Implications for Intelligence**: Explains how the brain handles novelty, movement, and learning; contrasts with single-model AI by emphasising parallel, distributed processing.
- **Evolution from Prior Work**: Introduced in Hawkins' 2021 book "A Thousand Brains," evolving from earlier frameworks on hierarchical temporal memory (HTM).

## Examples and Applications

- **Perception Modeling**: Each column models objects from different sensory angles (e.g., visual, tactile), voting to recognise an item like a coffee cup regardless of orientation.
- **AI Development**: Inspires sensorimotor AI systems, as in the Thousand Brains Project, for more flexible, brain-like machine intelligence.
- **Linguistic Insights**: Hypothesised to explain aspects of language processing, where columns model semantic elements in parallel.
