#core/appliedneuroscience 

- Neurological differences characterised by aberrant neural connections in the brain
- Manifest as abnormal connectivity or unusual extent of connections

## Key Features

### Brain Network Disorder

- Affects [distributed brain](../../../003_education/epfl/01%20Systems%20Neuroscience/Distributed%20brain.md) areas, not localised deficits
- Impacts areas involved in social information processing

### Connectivity Patterns

- Diminished long-range connections
- Increased local connectivity
- Patterns vary by specific condition

### Functional Impact

- Affects cognitive and behavioural processes
- Example: In ASD, altered connectivity in [visual pathways](../../../003_education/kings%20college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Visual%20pathways.md) and attention networks

### Detection Methods

- Traditional: CT scans, MRIs (insufficient)
- Advanced: [Diffusion Tensor Imaging](../../books/Introduction%20to%20Neuroimaging%20Analysis/Diffusion%20tensor%20imaging.md) (DTI), connectomes

## Associated Conditions

- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy
