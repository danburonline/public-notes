#core/appliedneuroscience 

- Neurological differences characterised by aberrant neural connections in the brain
- Manifest as abnormal connectivity or unusual extent of connections

## Key Features

### Brain Network Disorder

- Affects [[distributed brain]] areas, not localised deficits
- Impacts areas involved in social information processing

### Connectivity Patterns

- Diminished long-range connections
- Increased local connectivity
- Patterns vary by specific condition

### Functional Impact

- Affects cognitive and behavioural processes
- Example: In ASD, altered connectivity in [[visual pathways]] and attention networks

### Detection Methods

- Traditional: CT scans, MRIs (insufficient)
- Advanced: [[Diffusion Tensor Imaging]] (DTI), connectomes

## Associated Conditions

- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy
