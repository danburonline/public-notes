## Top-down Approach

- Traditional method
- Uses large, pre-formed scaffolds
- Limited cell types seeded onto scaffolds
- Bulk culture to form tissue-like structures
- **Limitations:**
  - Difficulty creating fully functional tissues
  - Challenges in replicating complex tissue architecture

## Bottom-up Approach (Developmental Engineering)

- Newer strategy
- Uses modular building blocks
- Incorporates multiple cell types
- Aims to replicate natural developmental processes
- **Advantages:**
  - Better control over tissue architecture
  - Potential for creating fully functional tissues
  - Versatile applications (drug screening, etc.)

## Key Differences

| Aspect        | Top-down          | Bottom-up              |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Scaffold      | Large, pre-formed | Modular, smaller units |
| Cell Types    | Limited           | Multiple               |
| Assembly      | Bulk seeding      | Gradual, developmental |
| Functionality | Challenging       | Potentially better     |
| Customisation | Limited           | Highly customisable    |
