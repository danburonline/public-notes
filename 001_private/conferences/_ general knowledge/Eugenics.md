Coined by [Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) in 1883, the concept of eugenics aimed to **improve the genetic quality of the human population.** However, it was founded on a flawed understanding of heredity and human traits, leading to significant ethical concerns and controversies surrounding its application.

## Key Aspects

- **Positive Eugenics**: Encouraging reproduction of "desirable" traits
- **Negative Eugenics**: Preventing reproduction of "undesirable" traits
- Pseudoscientific basis, often linked to racism and classism

## Historical Context

- Gained popularity in late 19th and early 20th centuries
- Influenced by misinterpretations of Darwin's and Mendel's work
- Practiced in many countries, including US, UK, and Germany

## Harmful Practices

- Forced sterilisations
- Restrictive immigration policies
- Marriage prohibition laws
- Institutionalisation of individuals with disabilities
- Nazi Germany's extreme implementation (euthanasia programs)

## Decline and Criticism

- Faced increasing scientific and ethical criticism in 1930s-1940s
- Discredited after association with Nazi atrocities
- Recognised as scientifically inaccurate and ethically abhorrent

## Modern Concerns

- Debates around prenatal genetic screening
- Potential misuse of advanced genetic technologies
- "Liberal eugenics" focusing on parental choice and well-being

## Ethical Considerations

- Challenges idea of human equality
- Raises concerns about discrimination and stigmatisation
- Ongoing debates about genetic interventions and reproductive technologies
