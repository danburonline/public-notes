Epiphenomenalism is a theory in philosophy of mind that posits **mental states or conscious experiences are byproducts (epiphenomena) of physical brain states**, without causal power over physical states or behaviour.

## Key Points

1. **Causal Relationship**:
   - Physical brain states → Mental states
   - Mental states ↛ Physical states or behaviour

2. **Core Propositions**:
   - [[Access and phenomenal consciousness|Consciousness]] is caused by neural activity
   - Consciousness does not influence neural activity or behaviour

3. **Implications**:
   - [[Conscious veto|Conscious]] will is illusory
   - Correlation between thoughts and actions explained by common physical cause

## Contrasting Theories

- **Interactionist Dualism**: Mental and physical states can causally influence each other
- **Reductive Physicalism**: Mental states are identical to or reducible to physical states

## Philosophical Challenges

1. **Evolutionary Argument**:
   - Question: How could consciousness evolve if it has no causal efficacy?
   - Challenge to epiphenomenalism: Natural selection typically acts on traits with causal impact

2. **Knowledge Argument**:
   - Question: How can we know about our conscious states if they don’t causally impact our behaviour?
   - Challenge: Our ability to report on conscious states seems to imply some causal efficacy

3. **Self-Stultification Argument**:
   - Question: How can we coherently argue for epiphenomenalism if our beliefs and arguments are causally inefficacious?
   - Challenge: The very act of defending epiphenomenalism seems to contradict its central claim
