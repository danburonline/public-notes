A craniotomy is a **surgical procedure involving the temporary removal of a bone flap from the skull to access the brain.** Unlike a craniectomy (where bone is not replaced), the bone flap is repositioned after the intracranial procedure, making craniotomy the foundational access technique for most modern neurosurgery.

## Pterional Approach

The embedded diagram illustrates the **pterional (frontotemporal) craniotomy**, the most commonly performed craniotomy variant and the standard approach to the Circle of Willis and Sylvian fissure:

1. **Keyhole placement** — A burr hole is drilled at the MacCarty keyhole, located at the junction of the frontal, sphenoid, and temporal bones near the zygomatic process
2. **Osteotomy** — A craniotome cuts along the planned trajectory (dashed red line), extending from the keyhole across the frontal bone and curving through the temporal bone to create a removable bone flap
3. **Muscle retraction** — The temporalis muscle is reflected inferiorly and posteriorly to expose the underlying bone
4. **Exposure** — Once the bone flap is elevated, the dura is opened to reveal the cortical surface—the diagram shows the exposed frontal and temporal lobes with superficial cerebral veins, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) emerging from the Sylvian fissure, and the anterior communicating artery (ACOM)

The patient's head is typically rotated 20–30 degrees away from the side of the lesion, allowing the frontal lobe to fall away under gravity.

## Indications

- **Tumour removal** — large brain tumours requiring extensive access for complete resection
- **Trauma** — severe head injuries with significant swelling or haemorrhage necessitating decompression
- **[Vascular](../../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/Cortex%20vascularisation.md) pathology** — aneurysm clipping and arteriovenous malformation repair
- **Functional neurosurgery** — electrode implantation for Deep Brain Stimulation, epilepsy surgery, and brain-computer interface placement (see [IDEAL framework](../../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/IDEAL%20framework.md))
- **Infections** — deep-seated abscesses requiring drainage and debridement

## Surgical Technique

### Planning and Imaging

Modern craniotomy relies on [stereotactic](../../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/Stereotaxic%20neurosurgery.md) image guidance—preoperative MRI/CT scans are co-registered with the patient's anatomy to plan the optimal incision site, bone flap size, and surgical corridor. Frameless neuronavigation systems track instruments in real time relative to the preoperative imaging.

### Procedure

1. **Skin incision and flap elevation** — a curvilinear or straight incision is made, and the scalp flap is reflected
2. **Burr holes** — one or more holes are drilled through the skull using a perforator
3. **Bone flap creation** — a craniotome connects the burr holes to free the bone flap, which is set aside
4. **Dural opening** — the dura mater is incised and reflected to expose the cortical surface
5. **Intracranial procedure** — the primary operation (resection, clipping, implantation) is performed
6. **Closure** — the dura is closed (watertight if possible), the bone flap is secured with titanium plates or sutures, and the scalp is closed in layers

## Variants

| Approach | Access | Typical Indications |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Pterional** | Sylvian fissure, anterior circulation | Aneurysms, MCA/ACOM pathology, sellar tumours |
| **Bifrontal** | Bilateral frontal base | Anterior skull base tumours, olfactory groove meningiomas |
| **Retrosigmoid** | Posterior fossa, cerebellopontine angle | Acoustic neuromas, trigeminal neuralgia |
| **Suboccipital** | Cerebellum, brainstem | Posterior fossa tumours, Chiari malformations |
| **Decompressive craniectomy** | Wide unilateral or bilateral | Malignant oedema, refractory intracranial hypertension |

## Awake Craniotomy

In awake craniotomy, the patient is sedated for the bone work but awakened during the cortical phase to enable **real-time functional mapping**. The surgeon uses direct electrical stimulation to identify eloquent cortex—language, motor, and sensory areas—allowing maximal resection while preserving function. This technique is particularly relevant for tumours near speech or motor areas and provides a live window into the relationship between cortical activity and conscious experience.

## Implications for Consciousness Engineering

Craniotomy is the **enabling access procedure** for any physical intervention on neural substrate. Every step of [Progressive Synthetic Neural Substrate Transfer](../../_%20general%20knowledge/PSNST.md)—from initial neural architecture mapping to sequential layering of synthetic tissue—requires controlled intracranial access that craniotomy provides.

> [!tip] Relevance to Substrate Transfer
> For [PSNST](../../_%20general%20knowledge/PSNST.md):
> 1. Craniotomy provides the surgical access necessary for [neural graft](../../videos/Neural%20grafts.md) placement and synthetic substrate layering
> 2. Awake craniotomy techniques could enable real-time consciousness monitoring during progressive transfer
> 3. The [IDEAL framework](../../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/IDEAL%20framework.md) classifies BCI implantation (requiring craniotomy) through structured innovation stages
>
> Craniotomy also underpins [Hemispherotomy](../Sizing%20Up%20Consciousness/Hemispherotomy.md)—itself key empirical evidence that consciousness survives major substrate alteration.

### Open Questions

- Can minimally invasive or endovascular approaches eventually replace craniotomy for substrate transfer procedures?
- How does craniotomy-induced inflammation affect the integration window for synthetic neural grafts?
- Could [perturbational complexity index](Neural%20correlate%20of%20consciousness.md) monitoring during awake craniotomy inform the consciousness verification protocol for PSNST?
