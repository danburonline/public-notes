A craniotomy is a **surgical procedure involving the removal of a portion of the skull to access the brain.** This procedure is essential for treating various neurological conditions.

## Why Perform a Craniotomy?

1. **Tumor Removal:** Large brain tumours often require extensive access for complete removal.
2. **Trauma:** Severe head injuries with significant swelling or bleeding might necessitate a large opening to alleviate pressure.
3. **Aneurysms and AVMs:** To repair complex aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations, a larger area might need exposure.
4. **Epilepsy Surgery:** Intractable epilepsy sometimes requires extensive cortical resection.
5. **Infections and Abscesses:** Deep-seated or large infections may need a large craniotomy for adequate drainage and debridement.

## Why Continue Craniotomies?

- **Comprehensive Access:** Provides sufficient space for surgeons to manoeuvre and visualise critical structures.
- **Safety:** Reduces the risk of injuring vital areas by allowing a clear and controlled operative field.
- **Effectiveness:** Ensures thorough removal or repair of pathological tissues, reducing the likelihood of recurrence or complications.
