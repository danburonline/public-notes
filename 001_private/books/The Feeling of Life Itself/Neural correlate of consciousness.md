The neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) refers to the **specific patterns of neural activity that are associated with conscious experience.** The NCC is a fundamental concept in the study of consciousness, as it seeks to identify the neural mechanisms that give rise to our subjective, conscious experiences.

## PCI and the Zap-and-Zip Method

One proposed approach to identifying the NCC is the [Perturbational Complexity Index](<https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(23)00733-7/fulltext>) (PCI), developed by [Giulio Tononi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Tononi). PCI is a measure of the complexity of a system’s response to a perturbation, with the idea that conscious systems should be able to generate a complex, differentiated response.

Tononi has proposed a specific “zap-and-zip” method for measuring PCI:
1. **Zap**: Apply a brief, localised perturbation to the system, such as a TMS pulse to the brain.
2. **Record**: Record the system’s response to the perturbation, such as the pattern of neural activity.
3. **Analyse**: Analyse the complexity of the response using information theory measures like Lempel-Ziv complexity.

The PCI is then calculated as the ratio of the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the actual response to the maximum possible complexity given the constraints of the system.

## Implications for Consciousness

Tononi has argued that systems with higher PCI, like the awake human brain, are more likely to be conscious, whereas systems with lower PCI, like a computer running a simple program, are likely to be unconscious. The idea is that the NCC should be characterised by the complexity and differentiation of neural activity, rather than just the overall level of activity.
