Multiple realisability is a **concept in the philosophy of mind that asserts that different physical systems can instantiate the same mental state or property.** In other words, distinct physical structures can embody the same mental phenomena or consciousness.

## Implications in Consciousness Research

- **Diversity of Conscious Entities:** Suggests that different creatures, including potentially those with significantly different brain structures or non-biological entities, might experience consciousness akin to humans.
- **Challenges to Reductionism:** Poses a challenge to reductionist views by suggesting that understanding mental states or consciousness might not be solely about understanding the underlying physical or biological structure.
- **Support for Independent Sciences of the [[Theory of mind|Mind]]:** Bolsters the legitimacy of psychology and cognitive sciences as having their theories and explanations that are not entirely reducible to physical details.

## Significance

- **Artificial [[Types of Intelligence|Intelligence]]:** Impacts how we conceptualise and seek to create conscious machines or AI.
- **Study of Animal Consciousness:** Opens considerations for consciousness in a wide range of biological life.
- **Theories of Mind and Identity:** Influences philosophical debates about the nature of self, mind, and personal identity.
