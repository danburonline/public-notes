Conceptual blending, also known as conceptual integration, is a cognitive theory developed by [Gilles Fauconnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Fauconnier) and [Mark Turner](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Turner_(cognitive_scientist)>) in the 1990s. It **explains how the human mind combines different mental spaces to create new meanings** and ideas.

## Key Components

### Input Spaces

- Separate mental frames or domains that contribute to the blend
- Can be concrete or abstract concepts
- Example: In “This surgeon is a butcher,” the input spaces are `surgeon` and `butcher`

### Generic Space

- Contains schematic structure shared by both input spaces
- Facilitates mapping between inputs
- Example: Both surgeons and butchers work with sharp tools on bodies

### Blended Space

- The new emergent structure resulting from the integration of input spaces
- Often contains novel information not present in either input
- Example: The idea of an incompetent surgeon with the ruthlessness of a butcher

## Blending Operations

### Composition

- Projecting content from input spaces into the blended space
- Can create new relations not present in the inputs

### Completion

- Recruiting background knowledge and cognitive/cultural frames
- Allows for pattern completion based on background knowledge

### Elaboration

- “Running the blend” – developing the emergent structure
- Can lead to novel inferences and implications

## Types of Networks

### Simplex Networks

- One input contains a frame, the other contains specific elements
- Example: “Paul is the father of Sally” (kinship frame + individuals)

### Mirror Networks

- All spaces share the same organising frame
- Example: “In France, Bill Clinton wouldn’t have been impeached”

### Single-Scope Networks

- Inputs have different organising frames; the blend takes one frame
- Example: “He digested the book” (reading frame projected onto digestion)

### Double-Scope Networks

- Inputs have different frames; the blend’s frame is a hybrid
- Example: “Computer virus” (biological + technological frames)
