## Overview

Michael Graziano’s attention schema theory is a **scientific approach to understanding consciousness.** The theory proposes that awareness is a construct of the brain, similar to how our brain constructs models of other complex phenomena.

## Key Point

1. **Attention and Awareness:** The brain has specialised networks to control attention, determining what sensory information to focus on.
2. **Attention Schema:** The brain creates a simplified model of the complex process of attention, known as the “attention schema.”
3. **Caricature of [[Endogenous and exogenous attention|Attention]]:** This model is not an accurate reflection of the process of attention but rather a useful caricature.
4. **Non-Physical Entity:** The model includes the notion of a non-physical entity, which we label as “awareness” or “consciousness.”
5. **Prediction and Reasoning:** This caricature is useful as it allows the brain to predict the effects of different attention states and reason about them.
6. **Subjective Experience:** We subjectively experience this caricature model as being aware or conscious.

## Implication

Graziano’s attention schema theory suggests that our subjective experience of being aware is not a glimpse into a metaphysical realm or an emergent property of complex computation but a distorted, **simplified model created by our brains to help us understand and predict our interactions with the world.**
