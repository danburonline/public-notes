Interbrain synchrony refers to the **phenomenon in which the brains of two or more individuals synchronise or show similar patterns of activity when they interact** or engage in communication. It suggests a level of neural coherence and coordination between individuals and is believed to play a role in social bonding, empathy, and understanding between people.
