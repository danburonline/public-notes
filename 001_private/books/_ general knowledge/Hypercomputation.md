## Key Concepts

### Turing Machines

- A model of computation was invented by Alan Turing.
- It can simulate any digital computer’s computations.
- Defines the limits of what is computationally feasible.
- Certain problems, like the halting problem, are unsolvable by Turing machines.

### Hypercomputation

- Models of computation that can solve problems that a Turing machine cannot.
- A theoretical concept that extends beyond conventional computation.
- No practical model exists as of 2021.

## Models of Hypercomputation

### Oracle Machines

- Proposed by Turing himself.
- A theoretical machine that could solve the unsolvable, such as the halting problem.

### Quantum Computers

- Use principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations.
- Potentially capable of performing many computations simultaneously.
- As of 2021, no quantum computer has demonstrated hypercomputational capabilities.

### Non-deterministic Machines

- Can follow many computational paths at once and choose the correct one.
- Theoretical constructs that do not exist in reality.

### Infinite Computations

- Models that involve tasks that would take an infinite amount of time on a Turing machine.
- Examples include accelerating Turing machines or Zeno machines.
