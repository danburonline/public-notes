## Opening Principles

1. **Control the center**
   - Occupy and control central squares (e4, d4, e5, d5)
   - Provides greater mobility and strategic advantages

2. **Develop minor pieces quickly**
   - Bring out knights and bishops early
   - Typically before moving the queen
   - Knights often developed before bishops

3. **Castle early**
   - Ensure king safety
   - Usually within first 10 moves
   - Connects rooks and activates them

4. **Limit pawn moves**
   - Make only 1-2 pawn moves in opening
   - Focus on piece development

5. **Avoid moving same piece twice**
   - Each move should ideally develop a new piece

## Middlegame Principles

6. **Create a plan**
   - Have moves fit into definite plans
   - Avoid playing aimlessly

7. **Coordinate pieces**
   - Ensure pieces work together effectively
   - Maximise their potential

8. **Control open files**
   - Seize control with rooks

9. **Protect the king**
   - Maintain pawn structure in front of castled king
   - Avoid unnecessary weaknesses

10. **Look for tactics**
    - Be aware of potential combinations, pins, forks, etc.

## Endgame Principles

1. **Activate the king**
    - King becomes powerful piece in endgame
    - Use actively

2. **Push passed pawns**
    - Advance passed pawns
    - Pose significant threat to opponent

3. **Rooks behind passed pawns**
    - Place rooks behind passed pawns (yours or opponent's)
