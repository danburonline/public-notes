## Multidisciplinary Approach

- **Definition**: A multidisciplinary approach involves drawing on knowledge from different disciplines but stays within their boundaries. It combines various perspectives to address a problem without necessarily integrating them into a new framework.
- **Purpose**: This approach is used to provide a comprehensive view by combining insights from multiple fields, promoting flexibility and practical problem-solving skills.
- **Key Features**:
  - Each discipline contributes independently.
  - Focuses on real-world applications and teamwork.
  - Enhances critical thinking and creativity by combining different viewpoints

## Interdisciplinary Approach

- **Definition**: Interdisciplinary approaches integrate knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines to create a coordinated and coherent whole. This involves analysing and synthesizing links between disciplines
- **Purpose**: It aims to address complex issues by fostering a holistic understanding that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates knowledge across disciplines.
  - Encourages critical thinking and creativity through the synthesis of diverse perspectives.
  - Often used in fields like Environmental Psychology.

## Transdisciplinary Approach

- **Definition**: Transdisciplinarity goes beyond disciplinary boundaries, integrating knowledge from various fields and non-academic stakeholders to solve real-world problems. It seeks a unity of intellectual frameworks beyond traditional disciplines.
- **Purpose**: This approach is designed to address complex, multidimensional problems by engaging with diverse stakeholders and promoting systemic change.
- **Key Features**:
  - Involves mutual learning between science and society.
  - Integrates empirical, pragmatic, regulatory, and values-based knowledge.
  - Aims for socially robust solutions through collaboration with stakeholders.

## Key Differences

- **Integration Level**: 
  - **Multidisciplinary**: Different disciplines work together but maintain their boundaries.
