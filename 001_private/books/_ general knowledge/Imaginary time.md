Imaginary time is a concept derived from quantum mechanics and is used in quantum cosmology. It was popularised by Stephen Hawking in 1988. It's called "imaginary" because it **involves a mathematical substitution where the regular time variable $t$ is replaced with imaginary time $i\tau$,** where $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$.

## Wick Rotation

In ordinary quantum mechanics, imaginary time is obtained by rotating time into the complex plane. This rotation is called a **Wick rotation**, named after the physicist Gian Carlo Wick. When you calculate paths in imaginary time, rather than getting oscillatory behaviour as you do with real time, you get exponential decay. This changes quantum mechanical problems from being intractable due to wild oscillations to being solvable.

## No-boundary Proposal

In cosmology, imaginary time appears in the Hartle-Hawking state, also known as the "no-boundary proposal" for the universe's initial state. The diagram above illustrates the difference:

- **Standard Big Bang** (general relativity alone): The universe originates from a sharp singularity—a point where physics breaks down and time has a problematic "beginning."
- **Hartle-Hawking model** (general relativity + quantum theory): The singularity is replaced by a smooth, rounded geometry where time behaves like a spatial dimension. There is no edge or boundary—much like how the North Pole is a point on Earth but not an "edge."

By treating time as space-like at the origin, Hawking and Hartle described a universe that doesn't have a definite moment of beginning. Our conventional notion of time is said to [[Strong emergence|emerge]] from this more fundamental spacetime structure.

## Ontological Status

Imaginary time is **a mathematical tool rather than a description of directly observable reality.** Whether this formalism reflects something deeper about the nature of time—or is merely a calculational convenience—remains an open question in the philosophy of physics.
