Imaginary time is a concept derived from quantum mechanics and is used in quantum cosmology. It was popularised by [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) in 1988. It's called "imaginary" because it **involves a mathematical substitution where the regular time variable $t$ is replaced with imaginary time $it$,** where $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$.

In ordinary quantum mechanics, imaginary time is obtained by rotating time into the complex plane. This rotation is called a Wick rotation, named after the physicist Gian Carlo Wick. When you calculate paths in imaginary time, rather than getting oscillatory behaviour as you do with real-time, you get exponential decay. This changes quantum mechanical problems from being intractable due to the wild oscillations to being solvable.

In the context of cosmology, imaginary time is also used in the Hartle-Hawking state, also known as the "no-boundary proposal" for the Universe's initial state. By using imaginary time, Hawking and Hartle were able to describe a Universe that doesn't have a definite time at which it began â€“ instead, our conventional notion of time is said to emerge from a more fundamental concept of spacetime, where time as we know it doesn't exist and there's no singularity or "beginning" of the Universe. This model treats the history of the Universe as a four-dimensional spacetime that is finite but unbounded, much like the surface of a sphere.

It's important to note that the concept of imaginary time is **a mathematical tool rather than a description of reality that can be directly observed or measured.** As such, it's used to make certain calculations and theories more tractable or understandable.
