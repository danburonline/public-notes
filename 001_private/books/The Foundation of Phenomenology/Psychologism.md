Psychologism is a philosophical position that **attempts to reduce or ground logical, mathematical, or semantic concepts in psychological terms** or experiences.

## Key Concepts

1. **Psychological Basis of Logic**
   - Argues that logical laws are empirical generalisations about mental processes
   - Views logic as descriptive rather than normative
2. **Subjectivism**
   - Emphasises the role of individual mental states in understanding concepts
   - Can lead to relativism in logic and mathematics
3. **Empiricism in Mathematics**
   - Attempts to ground mathematical truths in psychological experiences
   - Challenges the idea of a priori mathematical knowledge
4. **Meaning and Mental States**
   - Proposes that the meaning of concepts is reducible to mental states or processes
   - Influences theories of semantics and philosophy of language

## Historical Context

- Prominent in 19th-century philosophy, especially German philosophy
- Associated with philosophers like John Stuart Mill and Theodor Lipps

## Criticism and Debates

1. **Frege’s Critique**
   - Gottlob Frege strongly opposed psychologism in logic
   - Argued for the objectivity and mind-independence of logical truths
2. **Husserl’s Evolution**
   - Edmund Husserl initially supported psychologism but later became a critic
   - His critique influenced the development of [phenomenology](../../../003_education/kings%20college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Phenomenology.md)
3. **Normativity Problem**
   - Critics argue psychologism fails to account for the normative nature of logic
   - Psychological facts about reasoning don’t necessarily imply logical norms
4. **Universality Issue**
   - Psychologism may struggle to explain the universal applicability of logical and mathematical truths

## Influence and Legacy

- Contributed to debates about the foundations of mathematics and logic
- Influenced developments in cognitive science and philosophy of mind
- Continues to be relevant in discussions about the nature of logical and mathematical knowledge
