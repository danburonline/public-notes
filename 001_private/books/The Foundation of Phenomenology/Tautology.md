#fundamental/logic 

A statement that repeats the same idea in different words, or is logically true in all cases. Two main types: logical (always true) and rhetorical (redundant phrasing).

## **1. Logical Tautology**

- **Always true** by logical structure.
- **Truth table**: All outcomes are "true".
- **Examples**:
    
    - _P ∨ ¬P_ ("It is raining or not raining").
    - _A = A_ ("A thing is itself").

## **2. Rhetorical/Linguistic Tautology**

- **Redundant repetition** of meaning.
- Often **stylistic** (for emphasis) or **unintentional** (poor writing).
- **Examples**:
    
    - "Free gift" (gifts are free).
    - "Advance planning" (planning is done in advance).
    - "Unexpected surprise" (surprises are unexpected).

## **Key Notes**

- **Logical use**: Found in math, philosophy, programming.
- **Rhetorical use**: Common in speech, ads, politics.
- **Avoid in formal writing**: Redundancy weakens clarity.
    

## **Difference**

|**Logical**|**Rhetorical**|
