Eliminativism, often referred to as eliminative materialism in the philosophy of mind, is the **view that certain common-sense mental states and concepts—such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and even consciousness—do not actually exist.** It challenges the validity of "folk psychology," which is the everyday framework people use to explain human behaviour through mental states like emotions and thoughts.

## Key Ideas of Eliminativism

1. **Rejection of Folk [[Psychiatry vs psychology#Psychology|Psychology]]**  
   - Folk psychology is seen as a flawed and outdated framework.  
   - Concepts like belief and desire are not grounded in scientific understanding and will likely be replaced by neuroscientific explanations.

2. **Denial of Mental States**  
   - Mental states, as traditionally understood, do not exist.  
   - Terms like "pain" or "love" are considered mischaracterisations of neural processes.

3. **Contrast with Reductionism**  
   - Reductionism seeks to explain mental states by reducing them to physical processes (e.g., neural activity).  
   - Eliminativism claims these states do not exist at all and should be eliminated from scientific theories.

4. **Scientific Basis**  
   - Motivated by advancements in neuroscience and cognitive science, which suggest many psychological concepts lack a coherent basis in brain function.

5. **Predictive Nature**  
   - Eliminativism predicts that as science progresses, folk psychological concepts will be discarded because they fail to correspond to anything real.

## Examples of Eliminativist Claims

- Outdated concepts like phlogiston (in chemistry) or the luminiferous ether (in physics) were eliminated by science. Similarly, terms like "belief" and "desire" may eventually be discarded.
- Some eliminativists argue against the existence of:  
  - **Qualia**: Subjective experiences.  
  - **Propositional [[Attitudes]]**: Mental states involving beliefs about something.

## Criticisms

1. **Intuitive Implausibility**  
   - It seems absurd to deny the existence of mental states when people experience them directly.

2. **Self-Refutation**  
   - Eliminativism may be incoherent because it uses concepts like "belief" to argue that beliefs do not exist.

3. **Empirical Concerns**  
   - Critics question whether neuroscience will ever fully eliminate the need for psychological concepts in explaining behaviour.
