The Five Factor Model (FFM), commonly known as the **Big Five personality traits**, is a foundational framework in psychology that **categorises human personality into five broad dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (often acronymized as OCEAN).** This model views personality as stable traits along continua, influencing behavior, emotions, and thoughts, and has been validated across cultures through empirical research, evolving from earlier trait theories.

## Key Concepts

- **History**: Developed from trait theories, starting with Allport's 4,000 traits and Cattell's 16 factors; key advancements by Fiske (1949), Goldberg (1981), and McCrae & Costa (1987).
- **Measurement**: Assessed via self-report questionnaires or inventories like the NEO-PI-R, placing individuals on spectra for each trait.
- **Applications**: Used in clinical psychology, workplace assessments, relationship counselling, and predicting behaviours; helps identify positive/negative secondary traits.
- **Criticisms**: Debates on trait labels; may overlook cultural nuances or situational influences.

## The Five Traits

Each trait spans a continuum, with facets highlighting sub-aspects:

- **Openness to Experience**: High: Creative, curious, open to new ideas; Low: Conventional, prefers routine. Facets: Imagination, insight, adventurousness.
- **Conscientiousness**: High: Organised, responsible, goal-oriented; Low: Careless, impulsive. Facets: Attention to detail, persistence, reliability.
- **Extraversion**: High: Sociable, energetic, assertive; Low: Reserved, introspective. Facets: Talkativeness, emotional expressiveness, sociability.
- **Agreeableness**: High: Cooperative, empathetic, kind; Low: Competitive, suspicious. Facets: Altruism, trust, prosocial behaviour.
- **Neuroticism**: High: Anxious, moody, emotionally unstable; Low: Calm, resilient. Facets: [Stress](../../../003_education/kings-college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Stress.md) vulnerability, irritability, sadness.
