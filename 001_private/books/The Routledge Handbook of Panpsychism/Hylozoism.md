Hylozoism is the philosophical **doctrine that all matter is alive or possesses life**, either inherently or through participation in a universal life principle.

## Key Features

- Asserts that life or animation is a fundamental property of all matter, not just living organisms.
- Distinct from:
  - **Animism**: which personifies nature.
  - **Panpsychism**: which attributes consciousness or sensation to all matter.
- Focuses on the presence of life or vital activity in matter, not necessarily consciousness.

## Historical Context

- **Ancient Greek Philosophy**:  
  Early thinkers like **Thales**, **Anaximenes**, and **Heraclitus** considered elements (water, air, fire) as living or divine.
- **Stoics**:  
  Proposed a "world soul" that animates the cosmos.
- **Renaissance & 19th Century**:  
  Revived as a reaction to mechanistic and reductionist views of nature.
- **Modern Science**:  
  Some, like **Ernst Haeckel**, blurred the distinction between living and non-living matter.
