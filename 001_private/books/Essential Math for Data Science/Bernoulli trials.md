A **Bernoulli trial** is a random experiment with two possible outcomes: **success** and **failure**. This type of trial is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.

## Key Properties

1. **Two Outcomes**: The experiment results in exactly two outcomes. These can represent any two mutually exclusive outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, True/False, Success/Failure).
2. **Constant Probability**: The probability of success, denoted by `p`, remains constant for each trial. Similarly, the probability of failure, `1 - p`, is also constant.
3. **Independence**: The trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not influence the outcome of another trial.

## Examples

- Flipping a coin (Heads could be “success”, Tails could be “failure”).
- A single attempt at a free throw in basketball (“Making the basket” could be a success, “missing the shot” could be a failure).
- Testing a patient for a disease (“Disease present” could be a success, “No disease” could be a failure).

## Bernoulli Distribution

The **Bernoulli distribution** is the probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 (representing success) with probability `p` and the value 0 (representing failure) with probability `q = 1 - p`. This distribution models the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial.
