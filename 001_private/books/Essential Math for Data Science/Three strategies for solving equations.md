Mathematical equations are approached through three distinct strategies, ranging from exact analytical solutions to computational approximations depending on problem tractability.

1. **Explicit solutions**: The ideal scenario where a general formula in terms of known functions can be found. While rare in practice, these exact solutions are invaluable for their precise representation and insight into system behaviour.

2. **Approximation methods**: When explicit solutions prove infeasible, reasonable approximations within a defined error tolerance suffice. This includes [[Asymptotic expansion|asymptotic]] and [[Perturbation theory|perturbative]] techniques — a cornerstone of applied mathematics. Particularly useful in physics where exact solutions often don't exist.

3. **Numerical solutions**: Solving equations via [[Algorithm|computer algorithms]] that assign specific numerical values to all variables through iterative computation. This approach has revolutionised mathematical problem-solving over the past six decades and is particularly effective for systems with thousands to millions of variables where analytical methods break down completely.
