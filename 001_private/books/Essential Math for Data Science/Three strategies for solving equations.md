**Three strategies for solving equations** range from exact analytical solutions to computational approximations, depending on problem tractability.

1. **Explicit Solutions:** Best-case scenario where a general formula in terms of known functions can be found. While rare, these exact solutions are valuable due to their precise representation.

2. **Approximation Methods:** When explicit solutions are infeasible, reasonable approximations within a defined range suffice. Includes [[Asymptotic expansion|asymptotic]] and [[Perturbation theory|perturbative]] techniques — a cornerstone of applied mathematics.

3. **Numerical Solutions:** Solving equations via [[Algorithm|computer algorithms]] that assign specific values to all variables. Revolutionised mathematical problem-solving over the past six decades; particularly effective for systems with thousands to millions of variables.
