The correlation coefficient is a **statistical measure showing the extent to which two or more variables fluctuate.** A positive correlation indicates that the variables increase or decrease together, whereas a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases.

## Formula

The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is the most common correlation coefficient. It is calculated as:

```
r = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)^2 * Σ(yi - ȳ)^2]
```

Where:
- `xi` and `yi` are the individual sample points indexed with i
- `x̄` and `ȳ` are the mean of x and y respectively

## Range

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:

- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation
- **0**: No correlation
- **1**: Perfect positive correlation

> [!example]
> 1. **Height and weight:** As height (in general) increases, so does weight. This is a positive correlation.
> 2. **Age and speed:** As age increases, speed (in general) decreases. This is a negative correlation.
> 3. **Shoe size and IQ:** There is generally no relationship, indicating no correlation.
