## 1. Subjective [Probability](Independent%20and%20conditional%20probability.md)

Subjective probability is based on a person’s personal judgment about the likelihood of a specific outcome. It is often used when using the frequentist or objective approaches is impossible.

**Example:** Predicting tomorrow’s weather. Your estimate might be a 70% chance of rain, based on your judgment of the current weather situation, past patterns, and perhaps your knowledge of meteorology.

## 2. Objective [Probability](Independent%20and%20conditional%20probability.md)

Objective, or classical, probability is based on the logic of probability and the physical situation at hand. It assumes that all outcomes are equally likely.

**Example:** Rolling a fair six-sided die. The probability of getting a 3 is 1/6 because there is 1 favourable outcome (rolling a 3) and 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

## 3. Frequentist [Probability](Independent%20and%20conditional%20probability.md)

Frequentist probability is based on repeated trials or the long-run frequency of the event happening. This approach defines the probability of an event as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number of trials.

**Example:** Flipping a fair coin. If you flip the coin many times, you would expect it to land heads about half the time and tails about half the time. Thus, the frequentist probability of getting heads is 0.5.
