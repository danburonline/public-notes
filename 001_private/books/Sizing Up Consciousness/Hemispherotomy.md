Hemispherotomy is a surgical procedure used in the treatment of severe and intractable epilepsy. It is a modified version of [hemispherectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherectomy), which involves **removing or disconnection one of the brain’s hemispheres.** Hemispherotomy, by contrast, aims to preserve more of the brain’s structure while still achieving the desired disconnection to control seizures.

## Indications

Hemispherectomy is typically indicated for patients with epilepsy that are localised to one hemisphere of the brain and do not respond to medication. Common conditions leading to this procedure include:

- Rasmussen’s encephalitis
- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- Hemimegalencephaly
- Extensive cortical dysplasia
- Post-traumatic epilepsy
- Perinatal stroke leading to extensive unilateral brain damage

## Procedure

The goal of hemispherotomy is to disconnect the epileptogenic hemisphere from the rest of the brain, thereby preventing seizure propagation. The procedure involves:

1. **Surgical Access**: A [[craniotomy]] is performed to access the affected hemisphere.
2. **Disconnection**: Key structures such as the [[corpus callosum]], internal capsule, and [[basal ganglia]] are surgically disconnected. Unlike hemispherectomy, large parts of the brain tissue are not removed, reducing the risk of hydrocephalus and other complications.
3. **Preservation**: Where possible, brain tissue is preserved to minimise the impact on cognitive and motor functions.

## Outcomes

The success rate of hemispherotomy in reducing or eliminating seizures is high, often exceeding 80% in properly selected patients. However, the procedure may lead to or exacerbate existing deficits, particularly in:

- Motor control, leading to hemiparesis on the side opposite the surgery
- Sensory functions, including vision, touch, and [[proprioception]]
- Language and cognitive functions, depending on the hemisphere involved and the age of the patient

## Rehabilitation

Post-surgical rehabilitation is crucial for maximising recovery and adaptation. This may include:

- Physical therapy to improve motor function and mobility
- Occupational therapy for daily living skills
- Speech therapy, especially for left hemispherotomy in language-dominant individuals
- Cognitive rehabilitation to support learning and memory
