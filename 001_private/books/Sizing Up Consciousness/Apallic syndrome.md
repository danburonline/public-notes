- **Definition**: Apallic syndrome, also known as a vegetative state, is a condition characterised by the loss of cognitive functions and awareness of the environment while maintaining non-cognitive functions and a sleep-wake cycle.
- **Pathophysiology**: The condition involves a disconnection between the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for consciousness, and the lower brain centres, including the brainstem and diencephalon, which manage arousal and life-sustaining autonomic functions.

## Etiology

- **Causes**: Commonly results from severe brain injuries, which may be due to:
  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
  - Severe systemic infections leading to sepsis
  - Major metabolic disturbances

## Clinical Features

- **Symptoms**: Patients may exhibit:
  - Open eyes during wakeful periods
  - Sleep-wake cycles
  - Basic reflexes such as swallowing or grimacing
  - Absence of meaningful responses to stimuli
  - Lack of voluntary movements or behaviours
- **Assessment**: Diagnosis typically involves clinical assessment and may be supported by:
  - EEG to assess brain activity
  - MRI or CT scans to visualise structural damage
