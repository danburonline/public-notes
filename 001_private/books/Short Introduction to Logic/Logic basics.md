## What is an Inference?

Inference in logic refers to the **process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true.** The act of inference produces new knowledge from the knowledge we already have. For example, if we know that “All men are mortal” (premise) and “Socrates is a man” (premise), we can infer that “Socrates is mortal” (conclusion).

## What is Deductively Valid?

A deductive argument is **said to be valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.** In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. For instance, consider the following argument:

1. All dogs are mammals. (Premise)
2. Fido is a dog. (Premise)
3. Therefore, Fido is a mammal. (Conclusion)

This is a deductively valid argument because if both premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

## What is Deductively Invalid?

A deductive argument is invalid if it’s possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. For example:

1. All cats are mammals. (Premise)
2. Fido is a mammal. (Premise)
3. Therefore, Fido is a cat. (Conclusion)

This is deductively invalid because it’s possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. Fido might be a dog, which is also a mammal.

## What is a Premise?

A premise is a statement in an argument that provides reason or support for the conclusion. It’s a claim that is a step towards a conclusion. In the example above, “All men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man” are premises.

## What is a Conclusion?

The conclusion is the statement in an argument to which the premises are intended to lead. It’s the claim that the premises are supposed to support. In the above example, “Socrates is mortal” is the conclusion.
