The Sorites Paradox is a **philosophical paradox associated with vagueness and ambiguity in language.** It’s also known as the *paradox of the heap*. The term “sorites” originates from the Greek word for heap.

## Description

The paradox is usually presented with the example of a heap of sand. Here’s how it goes:
1. Start with a heap of sand (let’s say, 1000 grains).
2. If you remove a single grain, it should still be a heap.
3. If you continue to remove grains one by one, eventually, you’ll be left with just one grain, which is clearly not a heap.

The paradox arises when trying to determine at which exact point the heap stopped being a heap.

## Formal Explanation

1. 1000 grains of sand is a heap of sand ([[Logic basics#What is a premise?|Premise]])
2. If 1000 grains of sand is a heap of sand, then 999 grains are also a heap. (Premise)
3. Therefore, 999 grains of sand are a heap of sand. (From 1 and 2)
4. If 999 grains of sand are a heap of sand, then 998 grains are also a heap. (Premise)
5. Therefore, 998 grains of sand are a heap of sand. (From 3 and 4)
6. By continuously applying this logic, you’ll eventually deduce that a heap of sand can be just 1 grain of sand. This contradicts our original understanding of a “heap”, thus creating a paradox.

## Possible Resolutions

- Reject one of the premises.
- Suggest that there is a specific number where a heap becomes a non-heap.
- Propose that the concept of a heap is inherently vague and lacks a precise cutoff.
