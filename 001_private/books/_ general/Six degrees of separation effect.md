The six Degrees of Separation Effect is an **idea that all people are six or fewer steps away from each other, so a chain of “a friend of a friend” statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.** This idea was first proposed by Frigyes Karinthy in 1929 and popularised in the 1990s by John Guare’s play of the same name. The effect has been studied in various fields, such as sociology, psychology, and network theory, and has been found to be true in many cases.
