[[Working memory model|Memory]] techniques are **tools that help in improving memory and recall.** Here are some commonly used techniques:

## Mnemonics

Mnemonics are memory aids that help in retaining information. They work by associating easy-to-remember clues with complex or unfamiliar data.

### Types of Mnemonics

1. **Acronyms**: Forming a word from the initial letters of a series of words. For example, “HOMES” to remember the Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).
2. **Rhymes**: Using short rhymes to remember facts, like “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November…”
3. **Visual Mnemonics**: Associating an image with a word or concept to remember it. For example, picturing a ‘sun’ to remember the name ‘Sonja’.
4. **Verbal Mnemonics**: Involves word associations, often using humour or absurdity. For example, remembering the term ‘mitochondria’ by associating it with ‘mighty chondria, the powerhouse of the cell’.
5. **Method of Loci (Memory Palace)**: Associating the information you want to remember with specific locations you are familiar with. For example, imagining placing different grocery items in various rooms of your house.

## Pegwords

The pegword method involves associating numbers with words that rhyme with them and then creating a story or image linking the pegwords with the items to be remembered.

> [!example]
> 1 is a bun, 2 is a shoe, 3 is a tree, and so on. To remember a list, you create a visual story. If you need to remember milk, eggs, and bread, you might imagine a bun dipped in milk, eggs in a shoe, and a tree growing loaves of bread.

## Chunking

Chunking involves breaking down a large amount of information into smaller, more manageable “chunks.”

> [!example]
Remembering a long string of numbers by breaking it down into chunks, like phone numbers (123-456-7890).

## Spaced Repetition

This technique involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. It is highly effective for long-term retention.

> [!example]
Initially, you might review information after one day, then after three days, then a week, and so on.

## Link Method

This method involves forming a mental image of items to be remembered in a way that links them together.

> [!example]
> If you need to remember a list of groceries, you might imagine a loaf of bread walking a dog (milk), which is bouncing a basketball (orange).
