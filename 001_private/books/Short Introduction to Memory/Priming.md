Priming is a **phenomenon in psychology that refers to the influence of a prior stimulus on later responses,** whether conscious or unconscious. This can significantly impact learning, memory, and brain processes. Here’s a detailed overview:

## Definition

**Priming** is the process by which exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus without conscious guidance or intention. This can occur in various ways, such as:

- **[Semantic](../../../003_education/kings-college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Long-term%20memory.md#semantic-memory) priming:** Occurs when the prime and the target are semantically related, i.e., they have similar meanings (e.g., “doctor” priming for “nurse”).
- **[Perceptual](../../../003_education/kings-college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Long-term%20memory.md#perceptual-memory) priming:** This relies on the form of the stimulus and is based on a sensory modality (e.g., a certain smell or sound may trigger a specific memory).

## Impact on Learning

Priming can influence learning by making certain information more accessible and easier to recall. For instance, a teacher might prime students for an ecosystem lesson by first discussing the concept of interdependence in nature. This pre-lesson discussion (the prime) helps students understand and learn the subsequent lesson (the target) more readily.

> [!example] **Example: A Coffee Shop**
> A coffee shop wants to boost sales of its speciality coffees. They use priming in three ways:
> 1. **Visual Priming**: They prominently place appealing photos of speciality coffees to make customers think about these drinks.
>  2. **Semantic Priming**: They use words like “artisan” and “gourmet” in their menu descriptions to create luxury and high-quality associations.
> 3. **Sensory Priming**: They brew coffee near the entrance, so the aroma primes customers’ senses and increases their desire for coffee.
> 
> By the time customers order, they’ve been primed to desire speciality coffees, likely increasing sales of these high-end products. This example illustrates how marketers use priming as a subtle tool to influence consumer behaviour.
