“The Seven Sins of Memory” refers to a framework developed by psychologist [Daniel Schacter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Schacter), **illustrating the ways in which human memory can fail us.** These are divided into three categories: sins of omission (where memory is absent), sins of commission (where memory is present but flawed), and one sin that is a bit of both.

## Sins of Omission

### 1. Transience

- **Definition**: The decreasing accessibility of memory over time.
- **Study Tip**: Regular review and repetition help to combat transience.

### 2. Absent-Mindedness

- **Definition**: Lapses of attention and forgetting to do things.
- **Study Tip**: Develop habits and use reminders to reduce absent-minded errors.

### 3. Blocking

- **Definition**: The temporary inability to retrieve a memory.
- **Study Tip**: Learn to relax and not panic when you can’t recall information, as [stress](../../../003_education/kings-college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Stress.md) can increase blocking.

## Sins of Commission

### 4. Misattribution

- **Definition**: Assigning a memory to the wrong source.
- **Study Tip**: Engage deeply with the material, using elaborative encoding to better anchor memories.

### 5. Suggestibility

- **Definition**: [Memories](../../../003_education/kings-college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Flashbulb%20memories.md) that are implanted as a result of leading questions, comments, or suggestions.
- **Study Tip**: Keep your sources pure—avoid discussing study material with others before you have learned it well.

### 6. [Bias](../../../003_education/kings-college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Appraisal.md#appraisal-bias)

- **Definition**: The influence of current knowledge and beliefs on how we remember our past.
- **Study Tip**: Attempt to think critically and evaluate information objectively.

## Sin of Both Omission and Commission

### 7. Persistence

- **Definition**: The unwanted recollection of memories that we cannot forget.
- **Study Tip**: Develop a balanced study routine and mindfulness practices to reduce [stress](../../../003_education/kings-college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Stress.md) and intrusive thoughts.
