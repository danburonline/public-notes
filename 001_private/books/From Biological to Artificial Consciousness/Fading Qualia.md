Fading qualia is a **thought experiment proposed by philosopher [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers)** in his 1996 book "[The Conscious Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Conscious-Mind-Search-Fundamental-Philosophy/dp/0195117891)." It forms part of his argument for organisational invariance in consciousness, challenging the idea that consciousness requires a specific biological substrate. By imagining the gradual replacement of biological neurons with artificial components, Chalmers explores the implications for conscious experience, questioning whether consciousness is tied to biology or could potentially exist in non-biological systems with equivalent functional organisation.

## The Experiment

1. Start with conscious human (e.g., Chalmers) and functionally identical silicon robot
2. Gradually replace human neurons with silicon chips
3. Maintain same functional organisation throughout process

## Possible Outcomes

1. Suddenly Disappearing Qualia: [[Levels of cognitive complexity#Consciousness|Consciousness]] vanishes at a specific point
2. Fading Qualia: Consciousness gradually fades away
3. Unchanged Qualia: Consciousness remains the same

## Chalmers' Argument

- Suddenly disappearing qualia implausible (single neuron causing total loss)
- Fading qualia leads to implausible consequences:
  - Intermediate being (e.g., "Joe") with incorrect conscious experiences
  - Strong dissociation between cognition and consciousness
- Concludes only plausible option is unchanged qualia

## Implications

- Supports principle of organisational invariance
- Consciousness arises from functional organisation, not specific physical substrate
- Suggests possibility of artificial consciousness in non-biological systems

## Criticisms and Counterarguments

1. Gradualism trap (Mogensen, 2024)
   - Abrupt changes possible from gradual alterations in complex systems
2. Partial brain argument (Mallah)
   - Consciousness becomes partial, not fading
3. Introspective reliability (Schwitzgebel)
   - Inconsistent trust in introspective judgments across stages
4. Empirical objections (Aides)
   - Questioning application of physical principles to qualia

## Significance

- Influential in philosophy of mind and consciousness studies
- Informs debates on artificial consciousness and mind uploading
- Challenges traditional views on the nature of consciousness
