## Positive Science

Positive science, **also known as positivist or empirical science,** refers to the study of phenomena based on observable, empirical, and measurable evidence. It typically seeks to formulate laws based on observed patterns and predict outcomes.

**Examples:** Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

- **Physics:** The law of gravity is a positive science example. It’s based on empirical observations and measurable evidence.
- **Chemistry:** The reactions between different chemicals and their outcomes can be studied and predicted, which makes it a part of positive science.
- **Biology:** The study of cellular processes is based on observable and measurable phenomena.

## Non-Positive Science

Non-positive science refers to areas of study that are not solely based on empirical observations or measurable data. This could include disciplines that are interpretative, subjective, or value-based.

**Examples:** Philosophy, Theology, and Literature.

- **Philosophy:** It often relies on arguments and interpretations rather than empirical evidence. An example is the question of why we exist.
- **Theology:** It’s largely interpretative and often based on faith rather than measurable data.
- **Literature:** The interpretation of literary texts can vary greatly among different individuals, making it a non-positive science.
