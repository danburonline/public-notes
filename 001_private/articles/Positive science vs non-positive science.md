#fundamental/logic

**The positive/normative distinction** separates disciplines that describe what *is* (empirical observation) from those addressing what *ought to be* (values) or what things *mean* (interpretation).

## Positive Science

**Empirical science** studies phenomena through observable, measurable evidence, seeking laws and predictions. Rooted in Logical positivism (Vienna Circle, 1920s), which held that meaningful statements must be empirically verifiable.

**Characteristics:**
- Testable hypotheses
- Reproducible observations
- Predictive laws
- Value-neutral (descriptive)

**Examples:** Physics, Chemistry, Biology, experimental Psychology.

### Critiques

- **Popper:** Verification insufficient—science must be *falsifiable*
- **Kuhn:** Science proceeds through paradigm shifts, not pure accumulation
- **Feyerabend:** No single scientific method ("epistemological anarchism")

## Normative & Interpretive Disciplines

Often mislabelled "non-positive science." Two distinct categories:

### Normative Sciences

Concerned with values and *ought* statements.

- **Ethics:** What actions are morally right?
- **Aesthetics:** What constitutes beauty?

### Hermeneutic Disciplines

Concerned with meaning and interpretation ([Hermeneutics](../_%20general%20knowledge/Hermeneutics.md)).

- **[Philosophy](../books/_%20general%20knowledge/Main%20branches%20of%20philosophy.md):** Argumentation and conceptual analysis
- **Theology:** Interprets texts and traditions, grounded in faith
- **Literature:** Meaning varies by reader—interpretation over measurement

### Note on History

History is *empirical* (uses documents, artefacts) but *interpretive* in contextualisation. Straddles both categories.

## The Demarcation Problem

What distinguishes science from non-science? No consensus:

| Criterion | Proponent | Limitation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Verifiability | Vienna Circle | Excludes universal laws |
| Falsifiability | Popper | Some sciences aren't easily falsifiable |
| Paradigms | Kuhn | Relativises truth to consensus |
