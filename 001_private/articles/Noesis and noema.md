## Definitions

- **Noesis**:
	In [[phenomenology]], a branch of philosophy, Noesis refers to the act of conscious thinking or cognition. It’s the part of the mind involving thought, understanding, and self-awareness.

- **Noema**:
	Noema, on the other hand, refers to the object or content of thought, perception, or a similar mental act.

## Origin

Both concepts were central to the philosophy of [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl), the founder of [[phenomenology]]. They are also integral to the phenomenological research method.

## Key Distinctions

- **Noesis is the process**: it’s the act of perceiving, thinking, or understanding.
- **Noema is the product**: it’s what is perceived, thought of, or understood.

## Example

Consider reading a book:

- The Noesis is the act of reading, understanding, and interpreting the words on the page.
- The content, ideas, and themes you extract from the book are the Noema.
