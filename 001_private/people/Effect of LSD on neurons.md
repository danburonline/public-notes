## Interaction with Serotonin Receptors

LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) affects the brain at a neuronal level by interacting with serotonin receptors, crucial for mood, perception, and cognition.

### Key Points

1. **Agonist Action**:
   - LSD acts as an agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor.
   - Mimics serotonin but leads to distinct signalling differences.
2. **Receptor Activation**:
   - Activation triggers a cascade of intracellular events.
   - Involves G-proteins and pathways like the phosphoinositide pathway, increasing IP3 and DAG levels, altering calcium ion concentrations and PKC activity.
3. **Altered Neural Firing**:
   - Changes the firing patterns of neurons.
   - Increases excitability and synchronises neural oscillations, affecting perception and thought.

## Effects on Synaptic Transmission

LSDâ€™s interaction with serotonin receptors affects neurotransmission:

1. **Increased Glutamate Release**:
   - Enhances glutamate release in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex.
   - Leads to heightened sensory perception and cognitive flexibility.
2. **Modulation of Other Neurotransmitters**:
   - Indirectly affects dopamine and norepinephrine levels and activity.
   - Alters mood, attention, and arousal.
3. **Synaptic Plasticity**:
   - Changes synaptic strength and plasticity over time.
   - May result in long-term psychological and behavioural changes.

## Structural and Functional Changes

1. **Dendritic Spine Density**:
   - Possible increase in dendritic spine density on cortical neurons.
   - Enhances synaptic connectivity and communication.
2. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Alters functional connectivity within and between brain networks.
   - Decreases connectivity within the default mode network (DMN).
   - Increases connectivity between the DMN and other networks, leading to altered perception and a sense of unity with the environment.
