Homo economicus, or “economic man,” is a theoretical concept in economics **representing a rational agent who acts in pure self-interest.**

## Key Characteristics

1. **Rational decision-making**: Always makes logical choices
2. **Perfect information**: Has complete knowledge of the market
3. **Utility maximization**: Aims to maximise personal benefit or satisfaction
4. **Consistency**: Acts in line with their preferences

## Role in Economic Theory

- Foundation for many classical and neoclassical economic models
- Used to predict market behaviour and outcomes
- Helps simplify complex economic scenarios for analysis

## Criticisms

1. **Oversimplification**: Doesn’t capture the complexity of human behaviour
2. **Ignores psychological factors**: Emotions, biases, and social influences are not considered
3. **Unrealistic assumptions**: Perfect information and purely self-interested behaviour are rare in reality
4. **Lack of altruism**: Doesn’t account for non-self-interested actions
