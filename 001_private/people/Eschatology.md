Eschatology is the **branch of theology concerned with the study of 'last things' or the end times**, including topics such as death, judgement, and the ultimate destiny of humanity and the world. It explores beliefs about what happens at the end of life and the end of the world, as well as the fulfilment of divine purpose in history.

## Key Concepts in Eschatology

- **Death**: The transition from earthly life, often considered the beginning of the eschatological process.
- **Judgement**: The belief that individuals or all of humanity will be judged by God or a divine force, determining their ultimate fate.
- **Heaven and Hell**: Concepts of reward and punishment after death, representing eternal happiness or suffering.
- **Resurrection**: The idea that the dead will be raised to life, either physically or spiritually, at the end of time.
- **The Second Coming**: In Christian eschatology, the anticipated return of Jesus Christ to judge the living and the dead.
- **The End of the World**: Various religious traditions describe a final event or series of events that bring history to a close and establish a new order.
