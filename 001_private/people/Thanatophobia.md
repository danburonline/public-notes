Thanatophobia, also known as "death anxiety," is an **intense and persistent fear of death or the dying process.** Unlike the normal concern or curiosity that many people have about mortality, thanatophobia goes much further, manifesting as overwhelming anxiety that can disrupt daily life and well-being.
