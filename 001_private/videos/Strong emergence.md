Strong emergence in physics refers to **phenomena that can't be fully predicted or explained by understanding their individual parts.** Examples may include complex systems or consciousness. While it suggests higher-level properties appear from nowhere, proponents argue it recognises complex phenomena that are best understood at their own level. Contrastingly, weak emergence refers to phenomena that, while unexpected, can be derived from lower-level properties.

> - Weak emergence: a system has a property not present in its parts individually, yet in principle it can be derived from the micro-level rules (often only via simulation).
> - Strong emergence: a system has a property that cannot, even in principle, be fully accounted for by its parts and micro-level rules.
