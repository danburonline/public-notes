Computational irreducibility is a concept introduced by [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram), indicating that **certain computational processes cannot be simplified or shortcut.** To determine their outcome, one must perform all the steps of the computation without skipping any intermediate stages.

## Key Points

1. **Complex Systems**: Many natural systems (e.g., weather patterns, biological processes) exhibit computational irreducibility.
2. **No Shortcut**: For computationally irreducible systems, the only way to predict their state is by simulating each step sequentially.
3. **Predictability**: Such systems limit our ability to make long-term predictions.
4. **Cellular Automata**: Wolfram’s work shows many examples of computationally irreducible systems using cellular automata.
5. **Turing Completeness**: Computational irreducibility relates to Turing completeness, where systems can perform any computation but might exhibit irreducibility for specific tasks.
6. **Halting Problem**: This is linked to the halting problem, highlighting the undecidability and inherent complexity in predicting program behaviour.
