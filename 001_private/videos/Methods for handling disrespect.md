#fundamental/communication 

A framework of **seven graduated responses to disrespectful behaviour, progressing from disengagement through de-escalation to empathetic engagement.** The underlying principle is that controlling your own response is more effective than attempting to control the other person.

1. **Draw a Boundary and Exit**: The simplest way to deal with rude behaviour is to simply walk away from the situation.
2. **State What You Will Do**: Instead of telling the other person what to do, which can create a power struggle, state what you are going to do. For example, instead of saying, "Stop being rude," you could say, "If you continue to speak to me that way, I'm going to leave."
3. **Don't Engage With Unwanted Behaviour**: Rude people are often looking for a reaction. By not giving them one, you can often de-escalate the situation.
4. **Respond Slowly and With Sincerity**: Responding slowly gives the other person time to reflect on their tone. Responding with sincerity can also help, as it's difficult for most people to maintain a rude tone with someone who is being kind to them.
5. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Ask open-ended questions to better understand the other person's perspective. This shows that you're interested in what they have to say and are not just trying to prove them wrong.
6. **Ask for Permission to Share Your Perspective**: After you have listened to the other person, ask them if you can share your perspective. This reframes the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative.
7. **Let Go of the Need to Change Them**: The best way to deal with rude people is to drop the goal of trying to change them. Instead, focus on understanding their perspective.
