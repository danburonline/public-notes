The minimal self refers to **the immediate, pre-reflective experience of selfhood derived from sensory information.** It’s composed of two main aspects:

1. **Sense of Agency (SoA)**: The feeling that one has produced a particular outcome through voluntary action.
2. **Sense of Ownership (SoO)**: The perception that certain body parts or mental states belong to oneself.

## Study in Neuroscience and AI

- The minimal self has been studied in behavioural, cognitive, and neurosciences.
  - Focus is on exploring the antecedents and relationships between implicit and explicit measures of minimal selfhood.
  - Research also covers underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.
- The concept is of interest in robotics and AI.
  - Aim: To equip machines with a self-representation similar to humans.
  - [[Cognitive psychology vs cognitive neuroscience|Cognitive]] robotics and developmental robotics are key fields in this research.

## Theoretical Accounts of Minimal [[Independent self and interdependent self#Independent self|Self]]

1. **Informal Models**: These include box-and-arrow models and verbal formulations of laws and constraints for the emergence of SoA and SoO.
2. **Bayesian Accounts**: These propose that the perception of SoA and SoO is governed by statistically optimal information integration.
3. **Free Energy Principle**: This theory views the self as the result of a continuous process of optimizing one’s world model.

It’s important to note that many theoretical accounts are non-mechanistic; they focus on the computational level of cognition rather than specifying the underlying mechanisms.

## Mechanistic Models

For a better understanding of the minimal self, mechanistic models are crucial. These models:

- Align the model’s objective function or goal.
- Employ algorithmic implementation.
- Operate under specific conditions.
- Account for the complexity and context of behaviour.
