An open dynamic system is a **system that interacts with its environment.** Unlike a closed system, where everything is self-contained, an open system is influenced by its surroundings and can exchange matter, energy, or information with them. A key feature is that the system's evolution is determined not just by its internal rules and initial state, but also by these external influences.

## Key Concepts

### Components of an Open Dynamic System

*   **States (S)**: The internal configurations or "ways a system can be."
*   **Inputs (I)**: What the system receives from its environment.
*   **Outputs (O)**: What the system produces and sends back to the environment.
*   **Update Function**: A rule that determines the system's next state based on its current state and input.
*   **Readout Function**: A rule that determines the system's output based on its current state.

### System Behaviour

The "behaviour" of an open dynamic system refers to the set of all possible trajectories or signal patterns that the system can exhibit over time, following its internal laws and interactions with the environment.

## Examples of Open Dynamic Systems

The concept of open dynamic systems is applied across various scientific fields:

*   **Biology**: A living cell is a classic example of an open system. It takes in nutrients (input) from its environment, processes them through its metabolism (update function), and releases waste products (output).
*   **Physics**: In modelling atmospheric or ocean flows, temperature, pressure, and moisture act as external parameters that influence the system's dynamics. A billiard ball on a table with a pocket is another simple example, where the ball's trajectory can "escape" the system.
*   **Engineering**: In control theory and signal processing, systems are often designed to respond to external inputs. For instance, a thermostat receives temperature information from the environment and adjusts the heating or cooling system accordingly.

## Open vs. Closed Systems

The main distinction lies in their interaction with the environment:

| Feature | Open System | Closed System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction with Environment** | Interacts with and is influenced by its environment. | Isolated from its environment. |
| **Evolution** | Determined by internal laws, initial state, AND external influences. | Determined solely by internal laws and initial state. |
| **Examples** | Living cells, ecosystems, weather patterns. | A closed container with a fixed amount of gas, a perfectly insulated system. |
