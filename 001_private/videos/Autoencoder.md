An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning. It is primarily **employed in data compression, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction tasks.** The network consists of an encoder that **transforms the input data into a compressed representation (encoding) and a decoder that reconstructs the original data from the encoded representation.** The objective of an autoencoder is to minimise the reconstruction error, which encourages the network to learn useful features in the encoded representation.
