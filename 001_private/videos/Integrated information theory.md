Integrated Information Theory (IIT) was developed by psychiatrist and neuroscientist [Giulio Tononi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulio-tononi-1032b538). The central idea of IIT is that **consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, intrinsically linked to the amount of integrated information generated by a system.** This theory suggests that the degree of consciousness a system possesses corresponds directly to how much information it integrates as a whole, rather than as a collection of independent parts.

## Key Terms

### Integrated Information (Φ, Phi)

- **Definition:** A measure of the degree to which a system generates more information as a whole than the sum of its parts.
- **Calculation:** Measuring Φ in complex systems like the brain is computationally challenging and an ongoing research area.
- **Implication:** A higher value of Φ indicates higher complexity and interdependence among the parts of the system, which IIT associates with consciousness.

## Key Concepts and Implications

- IIT suggests that a system generates integrated information if the information generated by the whole cannot be reduced to that generated by its parts.
- Φ measures the extent of this irreducibility.
- In the context of a brain or a neural network, a high Φ value would suggest a high level of interconnectivity and complex information processing, which could be indicative of a conscious experience.

## Controversies and Criticisms

- As of 2021, IIT and the concept of Φ are still subjects of debate and scrutiny within the scientific community.
- Some critics argue that IIT lacks empirical support and that the theory's mathematical framework does not align well with our current understanding of neural networks and brain function.
