An engram is a theoretical concept in neuroscience that refers to a **hypothetical physical or biochemical change in the brain that represents a memory or learned experience.** It's often described as the physical trace left in the brain by a specific memory or learning event. However, it's important to note that while the idea of engrams has been influential in the history of neuroscience, their precise nature and existence as discrete entities are still subject to scientific debate and exploration.

## Historical Context

The term was coined by Richard Semon (1904), though Karl Lashley's failed search for localised memory traces led to the concept of distributed [engram complexes](Engram%20complex.md). Modern research has vindicated the engram concept through optogenetic reactivation of specific neuronal ensembles.

## Modern Engram Research

Contemporary findings demonstrate:

- **Engram cells**: Specific neurons activated during learning are necessary and sufficient for memory recall
- **Allocation**: Which neurons become part of an engram depends on relative excitability at encoding time
- **Reactivation**: Optogenetic stimulation of engram cells can artificially induce memory recall
- **Silent engrams**: Some memories exist as engrams that cannot be naturally retrieved but can be artificially accessed

## Implications for Consciousness Engineering

Engrams raise questions central to [Consciousness Engineering](../_%20general/Consciousness%20Engineering.md): if memories can be artificially activated, what does this imply for the relationship between neural patterns and subjective experience?
