An engram is a theoretical concept in neuroscience that refers to a **hypothetical physical or biochemical change in the brain that represents a memory or learned experience.** It's often described as the physical trace left in the brain by a specific memory or learning event. However, it's important to note that while the idea of engrams has been influential in the history of neuroscience, their precise nature and existence as discrete entities are still subject to scientific debate and exploration.
