Cartesian Materialism, a term coined by philosopher [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett), describes a common intuitive error in conceptualising the mind: embracing materialism theoretically (mind as brain processes) while subconsciously retaining dualistic elements from René Descartes' philosophy, such as imagining a central "theatre" where consciousness converges. This leads to flawed models of consciousness that hinder scientific understanding, as it assumes a unified point for experience despite evidence of [[distributed brain]] processing.

## Key Concepts

- **Materialism Aspect**: Rejects non-physical souls or "ghosts in the machine," viewing the mind as purely physical brain activity. Most neuroscientists align with this, dismissing Descartes' res cogitans (thinking substance) vs. res extensa (extended substance).
- **Cartesian Aspect (The Error)**: Subconsciously clings to a central convergence point for sensory data, even in materialist views, creating an illusory "finish line" for consciousness.
- **Cartesian Theater Metaphor**:
  - **Stage/Screen**: Sensory inputs projected for "viewing."
  - **Audience (Homunculus)**: A "self" experiencing the show, leading to infinite regress (who watches the watcher?).
  - Flaws: No explanatory power; contradicts neuroscience's parallel processing; generates pseudo-problems like precise timing of consciousness or "filling in" blind spots.

## Dennett's Critique and Alternative

- **Why It's a Mistake**:
  - Infinite regress: Doesn't solve consciousness, just defers it.
  - Lacks Neural Evidence: Brain processes features (e.g., color, motion) distributedly, without a single integration site.
  - Misleads Inquiry: Poses unanswerable questions assuming a centralised model.
- **Multiple Drafts Model**: Consciousness as ongoing, parallel "drafts" of information streams, edited and competing for behavioural influence—no final, canonical version.
