An [[Engram]] complex refers to a concept in the field of neuroscience and cognitive psychology, originally proposed by neuroscientist [Karl Lashley](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/karl-lashley). It suggests that **memories are not stored in a single location in the brain but rather distributed across various neural networks.** An [[engram]] complex represents the distributed network of neural connections and activity patterns associated with encoding, storing, and retrieving a specific memory or information. In other words, it refers to the ensemble of neurons and their connections that serve as the physical substrate for a particular memory.
