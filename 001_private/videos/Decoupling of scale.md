Decoupling of scale refers to the **principle that behaviours or properties at different scales can often be treated independently, with phenomena at one scale not significantly impacting another.** It allows for simplified models in science and engineering by focusing on relevant scales. However, in some fields, different scales are closely linked and can't be considered independently.

## Examples

### Physics

- **Effective field theory**: The Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem shows that heavy particles (high-energy scale) don't significantly affect low-energy physics — they can be ignored when modelling phenomena at everyday scales.
- **Separation of length scales**: Atomic-level interactions don't need to be modelled to understand fluid dynamics; molecular details "decouple" from macroscopic flow behaviour.

### Neuroscience

- **Micro vs macro brain dynamics**: Synaptic-level events (milliseconds, micrometres) can often be treated independently from large-scale network oscillations (seconds, centimetres) — this is what enables [Coarse graining](../papers/Coarse%20graining.md) approaches.
- **Multi-timescale dynamics**: Fast sensory processing operates somewhat independently from slower cognitive and memory processes.

## When Decoupling Fails

- **Critical phenomena**: Near phase transitions, all scales become coupled (e.g., avalanches in neural criticality).
- **Turbulence**: Energy cascades across scales, making them interdependent.
- **Certain neural dynamics**: Some brain states show tight coupling between micro and macro scales, limiting the validity of scale-separated models.
