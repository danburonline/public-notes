A formal theory is **a symbolic system consisting of a set of axioms and rules for deriving theorems from those axioms using formal logic**. The axioms are the starting assumptions, and the theorems are additional statements that can be proven using the inference rules of the system.

## Some Key Examples of Formal Theories Include

### In Mathematics

- Axiomatic set theory like Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC)
- Peano arithmetic for the natural numbers
- The theory of real closed fields capturing the real numbers

### In Computer Science

- Formal language theory, which defines languages using precise grammars and studies abstract machines like finite automata and Turing machines that recognise these languages
- Programming language semantics, where languages are given formal syntax and semantics
- Computability theory, which studies what problems are computable by different models of computation
- Complexity theory, which studies the resources (time, space, etc.) needed to solve computational problems
