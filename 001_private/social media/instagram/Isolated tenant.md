An isolated tenant in the cloud is a **dedicated environment for a single organisation**, offering enhanced security, privacy, and performance.

## Characteristics

- **Dedicated Resources:** Exclusive use of hardware, software, and network resources.
- **Enhanced Security:** A higher level of security due to non-shared resources, reducing data breach risks.
- **Customisation and Control:** Greater flexibility in configurations and settings to meet specific needs.
- **Performance Consistency:** Predictable and stable performance, suitable for high-demand applications.
- **Cost Implications:** More expensive than multi-tenant environments due to dedicated resources.
- **Compliance and Regulations:** Ideal for sectors with stringent regulatory requirements, such as healthcare and finance.
