- **Inductive reasoning** involves making generalisations based on specific observations. For example, if you notice that the sun has risen in the east every day, you might conclude that the sun always rises in the east.

- **Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, starts with a general statement or hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion. For instance, if you know that all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, you deduce that Socrates is mortal.


> [!example]- Examples of inductive vs deductive reasoning
> Inductive (specifics → general):
> - Observations: The last 6 buses on this route arrived late.
> - Generalization: Buses on this route tend to arrive late.
> - Caveat: Probable, not certain—today could be on time.
> 
> Deductive (general → specific):
> - Premise 1: All squares have four equal sides.
> - Premise 2: This shape is a square.
> - Conclusion: This shape has four equal sides.
