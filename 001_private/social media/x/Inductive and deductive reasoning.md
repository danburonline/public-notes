- **Inductive reasoning** involves making generalisations based on specific observations. For example, if you notice that the sun has risen in the east every day, you might conclude that the sun always rises in the east.

- **Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, starts with a general statement or hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion. For instance, if you know that all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, you deduce that Socrates is mortal.
