- **Definition**: Broken Glass [Syndrome](../../../003_education/kings%20college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Charles%20Bonnet%20syndrome.md) refers to a situation where a small problem, like a broken window, is ignored or not fixed in a timely manner, leading to larger issues or a decline in standards.
- **Origin**: The term is derived from the "broken windows theory" in criminology, which suggests that visible signs of disorder and neglect lead to an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour.

## Key Points

- **Implications**: The syndrome can apply to various areas such as urban planning, organisational management, and personal life.
- **Prevention**: Timely intervention and addressing small issues before they escalate are crucial in preventing the syndrome.
- **Examples**: In a business, ignoring minor compliance issues can lead to a culture of negligence. In urban environments, a single broken window can lead to more vandalism.

## Importance

- **Maintaining Standards**: By addressing small problems promptly, higher standards of order and functionality are maintained.
- **Preventing Escalation**: Early intervention prevents minor issues from becoming major problems.
- **Psychological Impact**: It creates a more positive environment, as neglect often leads to a sense of decay and demoralisation.
