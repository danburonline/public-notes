1. **Lucky by Fate (Blind Luck):** This type of luck is entirely random and beyond personal control. It refers to circumstances that happen purely by chance or fate, regardless of one’s effort or actions.

2. **Luck from Hustling (Motion):** This type of luck comes from persistent action and motion. The more one actively pursues their curiosity, conducts experiments, and explores, the higher the chance they have of encountering fortuitous opportunities. Even though the outcome is uncertain, the action and energy stir up the potential for positive collisions and combinations of ideas.

3. **Luck from Preparation (Personal Sensory Receptivity):** This type of luck is attributed to knowledge, skill, and perceptiveness. The more curious and skilled a person is, the more likely they will recognise opportunities in their field. It’s about being prepared and receptive to chance encounters or clues that could lead to favourable outcomes.

4. **Luck from Unique Character (Personal Motor [[Behaviourism|Behaviour]]):** This last type of luck is associated with one’s unique character, brand, or mindset. Individuals draw unique opportunities towards themselves by creating a distinctly personal lifestyle and being trustworthy, reliable, and integrity-driven. This kind of luck finds those who cultivate a unique reputation, as their distinctive character draws luck towards them.
