Optogenetics is a biological technique that involves the **use of light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive proteins.** The technique’s name, “optogenetics,” is a combination of the words “optics” (light) and “genetics” (the study of genes and their functions).

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how it works:
1. **Genetic Modification**: First, a gene that encodes a light-sensitive protein is introduced into specific cells. This can be done using various methods, but one common approach is using a virus to deliver the gene. The proteins are often [Ion channels](../../../003_education/kings%20college/01%20Techniques%20in%20Neuroscience/Ion%20channels.md) or pumps that can open or close in response to specific wavelengths of light, thereby altering the cell’s electrical activity. Such proteins are called ‘opsins’, and they come from a variety of organisms, including algae and bacteria.
2. **Light Activation**: Once the cells have been genetically modified, they can be controlled using light. By shining light of the appropriate wavelength onto the cells, the opsin proteins are activated, which changes the activity of the cell. In the case of neurons, this can either trigger or inhibit the firing of an action potential, depending on the type of opsin used.

The ability to control cell activity with such precision makes optogenetics a powerful tool for studying the brain. By **selectively controlling specific neurons, researchers can better understand their function and how they contribute to various behaviours** and brain diseases. The technique has potential applications in treating various conditions, including neurological and psychiatric disorders.
