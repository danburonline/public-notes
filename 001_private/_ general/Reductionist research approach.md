Reductionism is a **philosophical approach in science that explains complex systems or phenomena by breaking them down into simpler and more fundamental components** and understanding them through the study of these individual parts.

## Types of Reductionism

1. **Ontological reductionism**: Higher-level entities are nothing more than their constituent parts (e.g., minds are just brain states)
2. **Methodological reductionism**: The best way to study complex systems is by analysing their components
3. **Epistemic reductionism**: Knowledge of higher-level phenomena can be derived from lower-level descriptions

## Limitations

Reductionism faces challenges when applied to systems exhibiting [emergent properties](../videos/Strong%20emergence.md)—phenomena that cannot be predicted from knowledge of parts alone. Critics argue that reductionist approaches may miss:

- **Relational properties**: Interactions between components that generate novel behaviours
- **Context-dependence**: How environmental factors shape system dynamics
- **Downward causation**: Higher-level constraints influencing lower-level processes

## Contrast with Holistic Approaches

[Phenomenology](../../003_education/kings-college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Phenomenology.md) offers an alternative methodology that studies phenomena as unified wholes rather than decomposed parts. The [Naturalisation of phenomenology](../articles/Naturalisation%20of%20phenomenology.md) represents an attempt to bridge reductionist neuroscience with holistic first-person methods, acknowledging that subjective experience may require both perspectives for complete understanding.
