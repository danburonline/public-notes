Apophatic definition (also called *negative definition* or *via negativa*) describes something by stating what it is not, rather than what it is. It is commonly used in philosophy, theology, and discussions about concepts that are difficult or impossible to define positively.

## Why Use Apophatic Definitions?

- **Transcendence:** Useful for describing things considered beyond human comprehension (e.g., God, consciousness).
- **Clarity:** Helps avoid misleading or overly simplistic positive definitions.
- **Philosophical Rigour:** Allows for the elimination of incorrect or inadequate attributes.

## Apophatic Definition vs. Cataphatic Definition

| Apophatic (Negative) | Cataphatic (Positive)          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Defines by negation  | Defines by affirmation         |
| Says what X is not   | Says what X is                |
| Example: "Not finite"| Example: "Infinite"           |

> [!example] Apophatic Definition Example: [Consciousness](../books/Sizing%20Up%20Consciousness/Levels%20of%20cognitive%20complexity.md#self-consciousness)
> - Consciousness is **not** unconsciousness.
> - Consciousness is **not** a physical object.
> - Consciousness is **not** reducible to brain activity alone.
> - Consciousness is **not** something that can be directly observed from the outside.
> - Consciousness is **not** a simple collection of behaviors.

> This illustrates how an apophatic definition clarifies a concept by stating what it is not, rather than what it is.
