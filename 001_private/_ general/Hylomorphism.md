#fundamental/logic 

Hylomorphism is a **philosophical theory** developed by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). It states that every physical object is a combination of two fundamental components:

- **Matter** (*hyle*): The underlying substance or "stuff" things are made from. It is potential and indeterminate by itself.
- **Form** (*morphe* or *eidos*): The organising principle or structure that gives matter its specific identity and actuality.

## Key Points

- **Neither matter nor form alone makes a complete object.**  
  A thing exists as a union of both.
- **Example:**  
  - A bronze statue = bronze (matter) + statue shape (form).
- **Change and Identity:**  
  - When things change, matter persists, but the form can change.
  - Explains how objects maintain identity through change.
- **Body and Soul:**  
  - Aristotle: The soul is the "form" of a living body, making it alive.

## Relevance to Philosophy of Mind

Hylomorphism prefigures modern functionalism: Aristotle's claim that the soul is the *form* of the body—not a separate substance—maps onto the idea that mental states are defined by functional organisation rather than material composition. This is the historical root of [Multiple realisability](../books/How%20To%20Build%20a%20Brain/Multiple%20realisability.md): if what matters is the form (organisation), then different matter (substrates) can in principle instantiate the same mental properties.

The framework also illuminates the formal requirements of [Invariant brain emulation](../../002_profession/eightsix-science/Invariant%20brain%20emulation.md), where the goal is to preserve a system's functional "form" ($O(f(b)) \equiv O(b)$) while transforming its material substrate—a literal change of *hyle* with conservation of *morphe*.

A tension arises with [Emergent properties](../videos/Emergent%20properties.md): if form is irreducible to matter, are emergent properties a modern articulation of hylomorphic form? Or does emergence require abandoning the clean matter/form duality in favour of something more layered?

## Why is Hylomorphism Important?

- Explains how physical objects can change yet remain the same thing.
- Influential in philosophy, especially in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and theology.
- Provides the conceptual ancestor of substrate independence arguments in contemporary philosophy of mind.

> [!summary] Hylomorphic schema
> - Substance = matter (potency) + form (act).
> - Form explains identity, structure, powers, and teleology (final causes).
> - Change = actualising a potency; what persists depends on whether the change is accidental or substantial.
> - In living beings, the soul is the form of the body.
