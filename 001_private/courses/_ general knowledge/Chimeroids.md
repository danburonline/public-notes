Chimeroids are **brain organoids combining cells from multiple donors**, enabling direct comparison of inter-individual variation within a single structure.

## Overview

- Developed by researchers at Harvard University and the Broad Institute
- Allows co-development of human Cerebral cortex cells from multiple individual donors in a single organoid
- Highly reproducible model for studying human brain development and disease

## Key Features

- Generated by reaggregating cells from multiple single-donor organoids at Neural stem cell or Neural progenitor cell stage
- Each donor produces all cell lineages of the cerebral cortex
- Controls for growth biases in pluripotent stem cell lines

## Applications

- Investigating inter-individual variation in susceptibility to neurotoxic triggers
- Studied effects of ethanol and valproic acid exposure
- Revealed donor-specific differences in cell type effects and molecular phenotypes

## Significance

- Allows modelling of human genetic background effects on brain development and disease
- Scalable system for high-throughput investigation of inter-individual variation
- Maintains fidelity to endogenous tissue development

> [!note] Relevance
> Demonstrates genetic background effects can be isolated in synthetic neural tissue, relevant to substrate-level consciousness engineering.
