In the context of cryopreservation, mind uploading, and other neurotechnological interventions, existential altruism names **the ethical stance of valuing the survival or continuation of one's pattern, memory, or psychological structure, even when experiential continuity is irreversibly lost.** It reframes identity not as a binary property tied to uninterrupted consciousness, but as something that can persist in derivative or successor forms, provided structural and functional integrity is maintained.

## 1. Continuity of Consciousness

Continuity refers to the unbroken stream of subjective experience. From a phenomenological and process-theoretic standpoint, identity is constituted through this dynamic unfolding—a four-dimensional trajectory rather than a static pattern.

Cryopreservation and most mind-uploading scenarios entail a break in this continuity. From this perspective, if consciousness ends and later restarts (or is reconstructed), the original subject does not survive.

## 2. Pattern-Based Identity

A competing view holds that what matters is the preservation of the brain’s informational and functional structure. If a future being thinks, feels, remembers, and acts as you would, then—by this account—it *is* you.

This perspective is grounded in computationalism and cognitive science. It aligns with Derek Parfit’s reductionist view that personal identity is not what ultimately matters, only psychological continuity and connectedness.

## 3. Survival Models

| Model                     | Basis                         | Outcome                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Continuity-based          | Uninterrupted consciousness   | Original subject survives        |
| Pattern-based             | Structural/functional identity | Successor self survives          |

Pattern-based survival allows for functional preservation without subjective continuity. This shift has significant ethical and existential implications.

## 4. Existential Altruism Defined

Existential altruism is the decision to act in favour of the survival of a future being that shares one’s structure and identity—even when that being is not phenomenologically continuous with the original self.

This is not altruism in the classical moral sense (directed toward others), nor is it self-altruism (compassion toward one’s present self). It is a form of projected concern toward a *successor self*, one that may never be consciously experienced by the original subject.

## 5. Contingent Existential Altruism

A more specific position arises when one prioritises continuity as the ideal outcome, but accepts pattern-based survival as a fallback:

- **Primary aim**: Preserve the original subject’s continuity of consciousness.
- **Secondary aim**: In the event of continuity failure, ensure a structurally faithful successor persists.

This stance can be termed *contingent existential altruism*. It is a rational ethical position for those working within technological and biological constraints, where preserving continuous experience may not always be feasible.
