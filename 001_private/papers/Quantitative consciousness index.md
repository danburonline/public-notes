The term Quantitative Consciousness Index (QCI) refers to a variety of **methods aimed at objectively measuring and quantifying a person's level of consciousness.** These methods often utilise technology and data analysis to provide a more precise assessment compared to purely observational scales.

## Methods and Technologies

Several techniques fall under the umbrella of QCI:

*   **Electroencephalography (EEG):** Analysing brainwave patterns to assess consciousness levels.
    *   **Patient State Index (PSI):** An EEG-derived index used to monitor the depth of anaesthesia.
*   **Quantitative EEG (qEEG):** A more comprehensive analysis of EEG data for assessing disorders of consciousness.
*   **Auditory Evoked Potential Index:** Quantitative measure of changes in consciousness.

## Comparison with [[NICE head injury guide#Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)|Glasgow]] Coma Scale (GCS)

| Feature                 | Quantitative Consciousness Index (QCI) | Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**              | Objective, technology-driven            | Subjective, observational                       |
| **Assessment**          | Utilizes EEG and other data analysis   | Based on eye-opening, verbal, and motor responses |
| **Precision**           | Potentially more precise               | Less precise, based on clinical observation      |
| **Use Cases**           | Anesthesia monitoring, disorders of consciousness, coma prognosis | Initial assessment of head injury and coma         |

## Applications

*   **Anaesthesia:** Monitoring the depth of anaesthesia during surgical procedures.
*   **Disorders of Consciousness:** Assessing and tracking patients with conditions like coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.
*   **Prognosis:** Predicting the likelihood of recovery in patients with brain injuries or disorders of consciousness.
* Seizure management: Electrical stimulation at a quantitative consciousness index of 60-70 may improve electroencephalography seizure parameters without increasing complications.

## Limitations

*   The specific meaning and application of "Quantitative Consciousness Index" can vary depending on the context.
*   Interpretation of EEG data and other quantitative measures requires specialised expertise.
