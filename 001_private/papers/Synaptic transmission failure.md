[Synaptic](../../003_education/kings-college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Pre-%20and%20post-synaptic.md) transmission failure refers to the **inability of neurons to effectively communicate with each other at synapses.** This failure can occur due to a variety of reasons and can have significant impacts on neural function and overall brain health.

## Causes of Synaptic Transmission Failure

1. **[Neurotransmitter](../../003_education/kings-college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Neurotransmitters%20vs.%20neuromodulators%20vs.%20neuropeptides.md) Depletion**: Insufficient synthesis or excessive release of neurotransmitters can deplete available stores, leading to transmission failure.
2. **Receptor Malfunction**: Dysfunctional or damaged receptors on the postsynaptic neuron can prevent the proper reception of neurotransmitters.
3. **Synaptic Vesicle Issues**: Problems with synaptic vesicle docking, fusion, or recycling can hinder the release of neurotransmitters.
4. **Ion Channel Defects**: Malfunctions in voltage-gated [ion channels](../../003_education/kings-college/01%20Techniques%20in%20Neuroscience/Ion%20channels.md) can impede the generation or propagation of action potentials.
5. **Neurodegenerative Diseases**: Conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS can disrupt normal synaptic function through various mechanisms.
6. **Toxins and Drugs**: Exposure to certain neurotoxins or drugs can impair synaptic transmission by affecting neurotransmitter release, receptor function, or ion channel activity.

## Consequences of Synaptic Transmission Failure

- **Cognitive Impairments**: Issues with memory, learning, and attention can arise from ineffective synaptic transmission.
- **Motor Dysfunction**: Problems with movement coordination and control can result from transmission failures in motor pathways.
- **Sensory Deficits**: Impaired sensory processing and perception can occur due to synaptic transmission issues in sensory pathways.
- **Behavioural Changes**: Altered neurotransmission can lead to changes in mood, behaviour, and overall mental health.
