A dichotomy is a **division into two mutually exclusive and contradictory categories or groups.** It represents a binary opposition where there are only two possibilities, and those possibilities are defined as being the opposite of each other.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Two Categories:** The defining feature is the presence of only two distinct options.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** An element can only belong to one category or the other; it cannot be in both simultaneously.
*   **Contradiction:** The categories represent opposing or contrasting concepts. They are often presented as "either/or" scenarios.

> [!example] Examples of Dichotomies
> - **True/False:** A statement is either true or false (in classical logic).
> - **On/Off:** A switch can be either on or off.
> - **Good/Evil:** (Often used in moral philosophy and literature, though the strictness of this dichotomy can be debated).
> - **Male/Female:** (Biological sex, although gender identity is more complex).
> - **Alive/Dead:** An organism is either alive or dead.

## Usage and Considerations

*   **Simplification:** Dichotomies can be useful for simplifying complex situations and making decisions.
*   **Potential for Oversimplification:** The world is rarely as black and white as a dichotomy suggests. Many situations involve nuances and fall along a spectrum.
*   **False Dichotomy (False Dilemma):** A logical fallacy where a situation is presented as having only two options when more options exist. This can be a manipulative tactic. For example, "You're either with us, or against us."
*   **Continuous Variables:** Dichotomising continuous variables (e.g., age, income) can lead to a loss of information.
