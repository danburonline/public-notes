The Newman problem of the brain, also termed in consciousness science, is a **philosophical challenge originating from Max Newman's 1928 objection to structural realism**, adapted to neuroscience and theories of mind. It argues that purely structural descriptions of brain processes—focusing on relations without intrinsic properties—are overly permissive, allowing almost any realisation and thus failing to constrain meaningful theories of consciousness or neural function effectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Origins**: Stems from philosophy of science, where Newman critiqued Bertrand Russell's structuralism: Any set of objects matching cardinality can satisfy a structure, rendering it vacuous unless non-structural constraints apply.
- **Formulation in Brain Science**: Neural systems process relational information (e.g., change detection via spikes), but the neural/non-neural boundary hides intrinsic qualities of external causes or qualia, leading to "hidden" structures.
- **Implications**: Threatens structural theories like integrated information or global workspace; undermines claims that brain structures explain phenomenal experience, as they could map to arbitrary realisations without capturing essence.
- **Relation to Consciousness**: In neurophenomenal structuralism, it highlights how Q-structures (phenomenal quality spaces) mirror N-structures (neural activation spaces) via homomorphisms, but risks vacuity without grounding.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Spatiotemporal Grounding**: Perception transfers external spatiotemporal relations across boundaries, anchoring neural structures to the world via sensory intersections (e.g., overlapping modalities calibrating each other).
- **Structurally Derived Content (SDC)**: Phenomenal experiences as fully relational, individuated by positions in Q-structures; careful structure definitions (e.g., surjective homomorphisms) make the problem "disappear."
- **Neurophenomenal Structuralism**: Framework linking specific consciousness to relational neural maps; emphasises empirical methods like representational similarity analysis (RSA) for relational measurements over intrinsic ones.
