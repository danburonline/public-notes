[Derek Parfit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Parfit), a British philosopher, developed a **groundbreaking theory of personal identity over time, centring on the concepts of psychological and physical continuity.** His work challenges traditional views of the self and has far-reaching implications for ethics, survival, and our [attitudes](../../003_education/kings%20college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Attitudes.md) towards death.

## Key Concepts

### Physical Continuity

- **Definition:** The persistence of the physical body and brain through time.
- **Central idea:** Personal identity is maintained because the same body endures.
- **Caveat:** The body's cells are continually replaced, raising questions about whether strict physical continuity truly exists.

### Psychological Continuity

- **Definition:** The ongoing continuity of mental states, memories, beliefs, and personality traits.
- **Central idea:** Identity persists because one’s mental life remains connected over time.
- **Parfit’s stance:** Psychological continuity is more significant for personal identity than mere physical continuity.

## Thought Experiments

### Teleportation

- **Scenario:** A person is scanned, their original body is destroyed, and an exact replica (with identical memories and personality) is created elsewhere.
- **Key question:** Is the replica the same person as the original?
- **Parfit’s answer:** Yes, because psychological continuity is preserved, personal identity, in a significant sense, survives.

### Gradual Replacement

- **Scenario:** The brain’s neurons are gradually replaced with functionally identical artificial ones.
- **Key question:** At what point, if any, does personal identity cease?
- **Implication:** The absence of a clear threshold exposes the limitations of relying solely on physical continuity for identity.

### Branching

- **Scenario:** The teleportation process produces two exact copies.
- **Key question:** Which, if either, is truly “you”?
- **Parfit’s conclusion:** The notion of a single, unique, persistent self is problematic; identity may branch, and there need not be a single answer.

## Implications

- Parfit’s theory undermines the idea of a simple, unchanging self.
- Ethical questions about responsibility, survival, and death should focus on psychological connections rather than physical persistence.
