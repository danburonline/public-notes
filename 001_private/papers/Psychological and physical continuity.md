[Derek Parfit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Parfit), a British philosopher, developed a theory about personal identity over time, focusing on the concepts of psychological and physical continuity. This theory challenges our conventional understanding of self and has significant implications for ethics and our view of death.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Physical Continuity

- Definition: The persistence of our physical body and brain over time
- Idea: We remain the same person because our body continues to exist
- Note: Cells in our body are constantly being replaced

### 2. Psychological Continuity

- Definition: The continuity of our mental states, memories, beliefs, and personality traits
- Idea: We remain the same person because our mental life continues in a connected way
- Parfit’s view: More important for personal identity than physical continuity

## Thought Experiments

### Teleportation Scenario

- Setup: A person is scanned, their body destroyed, and an exact copy (including memories and personality) is created elsewhere
- Question: Is this the same person?
- Parfit’s argument: Psychological continuity is maintained, so in an important sense, it is the same person

### Gradual Replacement

- Setup: Brain neurons are gradually replaced with functionally identical artificial ones
- Question: At what point would you cease to be you?
- Implication: There’s no clear cut-off, highlighting problems with relying solely on physical continuity

### Branching

- Setup: The teleporter creates two identical copies
- Question: Which one is “you”?
- Parfit’s conclusion: The concept of a single, persistent self is flawed
