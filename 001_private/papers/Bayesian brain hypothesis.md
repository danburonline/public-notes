The Bayesian brain hypothesis proposes that the **brain interprets the world through the framework of Bayesian probability.** According to this hypothesis, the brain continuously updates its beliefs about the world based on incoming sensory information and prior beliefs, effectively performing probabilistic inference.

## Key Concepts

### Probabilistic Inference

- **Predictive Coding:** The brain predicts sensory inputs based on prior knowledge and minimises the error between its predictions and actual sensory data.
- **Error Correction:** Prediction errors (the difference between expected and actual signals) are used to update and refine the brainâ€™s models of the world.

### Bayesian Updating

- The brain uses Bayesian updating to revise its beliefs in light of new evidence. This involves calculating posterior probabilities by combining prior probabilities (existing beliefs) and the likelihood of new evidence.
