A **philosophical zombie** (or p-zombie) is a thought experiment introduced by philosopher David Chalmers in 1996. It describes a hypothetical being that is physically and behaviourally identical to a human but entirely lacks conscious experience ([[Qualia|qualia]]).

- **Physically identical:** Same neurons, brain states, and bodily processes as a conscious human.
- **Behaviourally indistinguishable:** Responds to stimuli, reports feelings, and acts appropriately—but has **no subjective experience**.
- Key concept: Separation of physical and mental, challenging **physicalism**.

## Purpose of Zombie Arguments

- **Critique Physicalism:** Show that physical processes can’t solely explain consciousness.
- **Explore Mind-Body Problem:** Relationship between brain states and subjective experience.
- **Test Theories of [[Multiple realisability#Implications in Consciousness Research|Consciousness]]:** Can any theory account for zombies’ apparent absence?

## Criticisms of Zombie Arguments

- **Logical incompatibility:** Can truly identical systems differ functionally (consciousness)?
- **Misunderstanding physicalism:** Some forms allow for non-physical properties.
- **Ambiguity of “consciousness”:** Different definitions lead to different conclusions.

## Relevance to Applied Neuroscience

- **Consciousness vs. Behaviour:** Studying neural correlates of behaviour vs. experience.
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces:** Can we create artificial consciousness or detect it in others? This question is central to approaches like [[PSNST|Progressive Synthetic Neural Substrate Transfer]].
- **Ethical Implications:** If zombies are possible, should we treat them differently?
- **[[Naturalisation of phenomenology]]:** Bridging first-person phenomenological methods with third-person neuroscience may offer tools to distinguish genuine consciousness from zombie-like processing.
