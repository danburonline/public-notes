- **Thought experiment:** Hypothetical beings are identical to humans physically but lack **conscious experience** (qualia).
- **Behaviorally indistinguishable:** Respond to stimuli, report feelings, act appropriately, but **no subjective experience**.
- Key concept: Separation of physical and mental, challenging **physicalism**.

## Purpose of Zombie Arguments

- **Critique Physicalism:** Show that physical processes can’t solely explain consciousness.
- **Explore Mind-Body Problem:** Relationship between brain states and subjective experience.
- **Test Theories of [[Multiple realisability#Implications in Consciousness Research|Consciousness]]:** Can any theory account for zombies’ apparent absence?

## Criticisms of Zombie Arguments

- **Logical incompatibility:** Can truly identical systems differ functionally (consciousness)?
- **Misunderstanding physicalism:** Some forms allow for non-physical properties.
- **Ambiguity of “consciousness”:** Different definitions lead to different conclusions.

## Relevance to Applied Neuroscience

- **Consciousness vs. Behavior:** Studying neural correlates of behavior vs. experience.
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces:** Can we create artificial consciousness or detect it in others?
- **Ethical Implications:** If zombies are possible, should we treat them differently?
