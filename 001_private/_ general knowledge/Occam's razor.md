Occam’s razor is a **philosophical principle that posits the simplest explanation is usually the best one.** Named after [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), a 14th-century English friar and philosopher, it is a heuristic to guide decision-making and problem-solving across various disciplines, including science, philosophy, and logic.

## Principle

The essence of Occam’s Razor is that when faced with multiple explanations for an event, the one that requires the fewest assumptions should be selected. This approach promotes efficiency and avoids unnecessary complexity in theories.

> [!example] Example
 Imagine waking up to find your car won’t start. Possible reasons could include: Dead battery, broken started, no fuel, seized engine, complex electrical issues

### Applying Occam’s Razor

You would begin with the simplest and most likely explanation: the battery. Checking if the battery is dead involves fewer assumptions compared to diagnosing a seized engine or an intricate electrical fault. If the issue is indeed a dead battery, charging or replacing it should resolve the problem, demonstrating that the simplest explanation is often correct.
