Living virtuously means **cultivating moral character traits such as honesty, courage, compassion, and integrity, and habitually acting on them.** The goal is personal and communal flourishing through the practice of virtue ethics and considered self-reflection.

## Key Virtues and Definitions

- **Honesty:** Committing to truthfulness in all dealings.
- **Courage:** Facing challenges and uncertainties with moral strength.
- **Compassion:** Exhibiting empathy and caring for the welfare of others.
- **Integrity:** Consistent adherence to ethical principles.
- **Temperance:** Exercising self-control and moderation.
- **Justice:** Acting fairly and upholding respect for all persons.

## Practical Guidance

- Cultivate each virtue deliberately: Reflect daily and set intentions for virtuous conduct.
- Seek a balanced approach (Aristotle’s “Golden Mean”)—avoid excess and deficiency in all behaviours.
- Prioritise reason and character development over rigid rule-following or pure consequence calculation.
- Model actions on exemplars of virtue, historical or contemporary.
- Habitually evaluate decisions: “Does this action express virtue?”
- Record moments of both success and struggle in practicing virtue for self-review.
