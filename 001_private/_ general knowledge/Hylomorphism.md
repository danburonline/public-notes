Hylomorphism is a **philosophical theory** developed by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). It states that every physical object is a combination of two fundamental components:

- **Matter** (*hyle*): The underlying substance or "stuff" things are made from. It is potential and indeterminate by itself.
- **Form** (*morphe* or *eidos*): The organising principle or structure that gives matter its specific identity and actuality.

## Key Points

- **Neither matter nor form alone makes a complete object.**  
  A thing exists as a union of both.
- **Example:**  
  - A bronze statue = bronze (matter) + statue shape (form).
- **Change and Identity:**  
  - When things change, matter persists, but the form can change.
  - Explains how objects maintain identity through change.
- **Body and Soul:**  
  - Aristotle: The soul is the "form" of a living body, making it alive.

## Why is Hylomorphism Important?

- Explains how physical objects can change yet remain the same thing.
- Influential in philosophy, especially in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and theology.
