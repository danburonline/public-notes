Elon Musk’s “algorithm” is a **five-step process for product development and manufacturing optimisation**, developed from his experiences at Tesla and SpaceX. It emphasizes efficiency, rapid iteration, and challenging conventional wisdom.

## Core Steps

1. **Question every requirement:** Don’t blindly accept specifications. Identify the individual responsible and challenge its necessity, even if it came from Musk. Make requirements “less dumb.”
2. **Delete any part or process you can:** Aggressively eliminate unnecessary components and steps. Add some back later if needed (a sign you deleted enough).

3. **Simplify and optimize:** Streamline remaining parts and processes for efficiency. Do this *after* deletion.
4. **Accelerate cycle time:** Speed up every step, but only *after* simplification.
5. **Automate:** Introduce automation *last*, after addressing previous steps.

## Corollaries

- **Hands-on experience for managers:** Technical managers must have direct experience (e.g., software managers should code).
- **Beware of camaraderie:** Excessive team cohesion stifles critical feedback.
- **It’s OK to be wrong, but not confidently wrong:** Admit mistakes and learn.
- **Lead by example:** Don’t ask employees to do what you wouldn’t.
- **Skip-level meetings:** Gather information directly from employees below management.
- **Prioritise attitude over skills:** Mindset is crucial; skills can be taught.
- **Maniacal sense of urgency:** Maintain a relentless drive.
- **Physics are the only rules:** All other requirements are recommendations.
