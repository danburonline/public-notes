Benign gliomas are a **type of brain tumour that originate from glial cells**, which are the supportive cells in the [[central nervous system]]. Unlike malignant gliomas, **benign gliomas are non-cancerous**, grow slowly, and generally have a better prognosis.

## Key Features

### 1. Types of Benign Gliomas

- **Pilocytic Astrocytoma**: Often found in children and young adults, typically located in the cerebellum, optic pathways, or brainstem.
- **Subependymoma**: Usually occur near the ventricles of the brain and are often found incidentally.
- **Ganglioglioma**: Contains both neuronal and glial cells, commonly affects children and young adults, often located in the temporal lobe.

### 2. Symptoms

The symptoms of benign gliomas depend on their size and location in the brain but may include:
- Headaches
- Seizures
- Neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, sensory loss)
- Cognitive or behavioural changes
- Vision problems
