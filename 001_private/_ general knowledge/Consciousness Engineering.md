**Consciousness engineering** is the applied science of understanding, preserving, and potentially transferring conscious experience across substrates. It bridges [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] inquiry with neuroscience, mathematics, and engineering to address questions of identity, experience, and substrate independence.

## Flagship Approach

[[PSNST]] (Progressive Synthetic Neural Substrate Transfer) proposes gradual replacement of biological neural tissue with synthetic substrates while preserving cognitive continuity—avoiding the philosophical problems of instantaneous copying.

## Theoretical Foundations

- [[Invariant brain emulation]]: Mathematical formalism for substrate-independent functional equivalence
- [[Diffeomorphic transformation]]: Smooth mappings preserving structure between state spaces
- [[Multiple realisability]]: The thesis that mental states can be implemented in diverse physical substrates
- [[Thousand brains theory]]: Cortical column architecture informing modular approaches to preservation

## Phenomenology and Consciousness

- [[Phenomenology]]: Methodological foundation for studying subjective experience
- [[Philosophical zombies]]: Thought experiment probing the relationship between function and experience
- [[Access and phenomenal consciousness]]: Distinguishing information availability from subjective experience
- [[Naturalisation of phenomenology]]: Bridging first-person and third-person methods
- [[Fading qualia]]: Gradual replacement thought experiment (Chalmers' organisational invariance)
- [[Integrated information theory]]: IIT's Φ as a potential substrate-independent consciousness metric

## Computational Frameworks

- [[Attractor state]]: Dynamical systems perspective on stable conscious states
- [[Phase space and phasing rotator]]: Mathematical tools for analysing neural dynamics
- [[Combinatorial explosion]]: Computational challenges in whole brain emulation

## Clinical and Applied

- [[Conscious veto]]: Free will and the timing of conscious intervention
- [[Hemispherotomy]]: Empirical evidence that consciousness survives major brain removal
- [[Quantitative consciousness index]]: Measuring consciousness objectively for clinical monitoring
