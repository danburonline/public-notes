**Consciousness engineering** is the applied science of understanding, preserving, and potentially transferring conscious experience across substrates. It bridges [phenomenological](../../003_education/kings%20college/03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Phenomenology.md) inquiry with neuroscience, mathematics, and engineering to address questions of identity, experience, and substrate independence.

## Flagship Approach

[PSNST](PSNST.md) (Progressive Synthetic Neural Substrate Transfer) proposes gradual replacement of biological neural tissue with synthetic substrates while preserving cognitive continuity—avoiding the philosophical problems of instantaneous copying.

## Theoretical Foundations

- [Invariant brain emulation](../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/Invariant%20brain%20emulation.md): Mathematical formalism for substrate-independent functional equivalence
- [Diffeomorphic transformation](../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/Diffeomorphic%20transformation.md): Smooth mappings preserving structure between state spaces
- [Multiple realisability](../books/How%20To%20Build%20a%20Brain/Multiple%20realisability.md): The thesis that mental states can be implemented in diverse physical substrates
- [Thousand brains theory](../../002_profession/eightsix%20science/Thousand%20brains%20theory.md): Cortical column architecture informing modular approaches to preservation
