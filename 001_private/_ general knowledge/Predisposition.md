Predisposition refers to a **tendency or inclination to develop a particular condition or behaviour, often due to genetic or environmental factors.** It does not necessarily guarantee that the condition or behaviour will manifest but instead increases the likelihood of it occurring.

## Genetic vs Environmental Factors

Predispositions arise from multiple sources:

- **Genetic factors**: Inherited variations affecting neural development, neurotransmitter systems, or stress reactivity (see [[Linkage and association studies]])
- **Epigenetic factors**: Environmental influences that modify gene expression without altering DNA sequence
- **Early life experiences**: Developmental events shaping neural architecture and stress response systems

[[Endophenotypes]] serve as measurable intermediate markers between genetic variation and clinical phenotypes, often reflecting underlying predispositions.

## The Diathesis-Stress Framework

The [[Diathesis-stress model]] formalises how predispositions interact with environmental triggers:

- **High diathesis**: Individuals require less [[Stress]] exposure to develop a disorder
- **Low diathesis**: Greater environmental strain needed before symptoms emerge
- **Protective factors**: Resilience mechanisms that buffer against predisposition expression

## Examples in Mental Health

Common predisposition-disorder relationships include:

- **Schizophrenia**: Polygenic risk interacting with prenatal stress or cannabis use
- **Depression**: Serotonin transporter gene variants combined with life adversity
- **Anxiety disorders**: Temperamental inhibition amplified by early trauma
