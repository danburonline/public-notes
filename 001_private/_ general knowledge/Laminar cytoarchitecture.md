Laminar cytoarchitecture refers to the **specific arrangement of neuronal cell bodies and their organization into distinct layers within a particular region of the brain**, most notably in the cerebral cortex. This layered structure is crucial for the brainâ€™s functional specialization and efficient processing of information.

## Key Features

### 1. Cortical Layers

The cerebral cortex is organised into six horizontal layers, each with unique types of neurons and connections:

- **Layer I (Molecular Layer)**: Contains few neurons and is primarily composed of dendrites and axons from deeper layers, facilitating horizontal connections.
- **Layer II (External Granular Layer)**: Contains small [[pyramidal neurons]] and numerous stellate neurons, involved in local processing.
- **Layer III (External Pyramidal Layer)**: Composed of medium-sized [[pyramidal neurons]] that project to other cortical areas.
- **Layer IV (Internal Granular Layer)**: Rich in stellate neurons, it receives sensory input from the thalamus, particularly prominent in sensory cortices.
- **Layer V (Internal Pyramidal Layer)**: Contains large [[pyramidal neurons]] that project to subcortical structures, including the brainstem and spinal cord.
- **Layer VI (Multiform Layer)**: Contains a mix of neuron types that project to the thalamus and other cortical areas.

### 2. Functional Specialisation

- Different cortical areas have variations in the prominence of these layers, reflecting their specialised functions. For example, the primary visual cortex (V1) has a highly developed layer IV for processing visual information.
- The motor cortex has a thicker layer V, accommodating large [[pyramidal neurons]] that project to motor neurons in the spinal cord.

## Techniques for Studying Laminar Cytoarchitecture

- **Histological Staining**: [[Nissl staining]] is commonly used to highlight neuronal cell bodies and distinguish the cortical layers.
- **Immunohistochemistry**: Identifies specific proteins within different layers, providing insights into the functional roles of each layer.
- **Electrophysiology**: Measures electrical activity across layers to understand how information flows through the cortical columns.
