The **Progressive Synthetic Neural Substrate Transfer** (PSNST) is a hypothetical cognitive preservation procedure envisioned by [Daniel Burger](https://danielburger.online/) to seamlessly transfer encoded neural information from a biological to an optimised synthetic biological substrate, ensuring the preservation of cognitive functions and personal identity. This is achieved by leveraging the effect of neuroplasticity and the automatic rearrangement of encoded information when brain tissue is destroyed slowly (such as in normally occurring effects like a brain tumour). This idea aims to solve the issues arising from classical mind-uploading by avoiding the destruction of a person’s cognitive continuity (i.e. the [teletransport paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox)), and also avoiding other philosophical problems related to mind-uploading and generally with whole-brain emulation. A potential method for the controlled cell death of neuronal cells could be induced by silencing them via genetics or a laser.

In contrast to other work, such as that from the [Hébert Lab](https://hebertlab.einsteinmedneuroscience.org/), the idea behind PSNST is that the new neural substrate is designed for high-throughput brain-computer interfacing (e.g., by genetically modifying the synthetic neural substrate to enable optogenetic interfacing, [[bioprinting]] it around electrodes/nanoparticles (neural dust), etc.). The goal is not to keep the person inside the original skull but rather to enable the explanted brain to be collocated across physical distances for redundancy (akin to globally distributed software on cloud computing) and to facilitate sensory input from simulated environments or robots, rather than a biological physical body. The main vision is to not only defeat death, but make it really hard to die.

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**:
    - Develop a synthetic neural substrate using 3D [[bioprinting]] technology to create brain organoids for layered [[neural grafts]].
    - Integrate electrode arrays within the synthetic neural substrate to facilitate neuron-level read and stimulation capabilities.
    - Prepare the biological brain for the procedure by mapping its neural architecture.
2. **Sequential Layering Transfer**:
    - Lay down a layer of synthetic neural tissue atop the corresponding section of the biological neural tissue.
    - Facilitate natural or induced connections between the neurons of the biological tissue and the synthetic layer.
    - Initiate a controlled termination of the biological neural tissue layer, prompting the transfer of neural information to the synthetic substrate.
    - Monitor the transfer process to ensure complete information transition and verify the functionality of the synthetic neural layer.
    - Repeat this process layer by layer until the entire biological brain’s information is transitioned to the synthetic substrate.
3. **Cognitive Preservation Verification**:
    - Utilise the integrated electrode arrays to perform comprehensive testing to ensure cognitive functions and personal identity have been preserved.
    - Conduct simulated reality testing to verify the synthetic brain’s functionality and the individual’s ability to interact with simulated environments.
    - Initially, the preserved brain can be set into an artificial coma, for example, via anesthetics, until simulated reality technology and/or robot technology is advanced enough to host the preserved individuals.
1. **Simulated Reality Engagement**:
    - Utilise the electrode technology to facilitate immersive simulated reality experiences.
    - Monitor and assess the individual’s interaction within simulated environments, ensuring a seamless transition from biological to synthetic cognitive functioning.

This PSNST procedure offers a potential solution for cognitive preservation and the exploration of simulated realities, thereby achieving what classical [[Mind-uploading approaches]] attempt to accomplish.
