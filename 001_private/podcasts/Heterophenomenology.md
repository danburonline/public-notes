[[Phenomenology|Heterophenomenology]] is a methodology used in the field of cognitive science to **study consciousness and subjective experiences.** Philosopher Daniel Dennett coined the term.

It involves **treating an individual’s self-reports as data to be interpreted in a neutral manner, similar to how a scientist might interpret the behaviour of a non-human animal in an experimental setting.** This is done without making any assumptions about the presence or absence of a conscious, subjective experience.

In simpler terms, heterophenomenology involves the collection of data on what it is like for individuals to have a specific experience based on their own reports without making any assumptions about the ‘reality’ of their experiences. It’s a ‘third-person’ approach to understanding another person’s subjective experiences.

**Here’s the basic process:**
1. **Data Collection:** The observer asks the subject to describe their subjective experience. This can be done in real-time (e.g., during a meditation session) or retrospectively (e.g., asking about a dream).
2. **Interpretation:** The observer interprets the subject’s report as a series of propositional [[attitudes]] or beliefs about the world. This is done without making any assumptions about whether these beliefs accurately reflect the subject’s actual experience.
3. **Analysis:** The observer then tries to explain these beliefs in terms of cognitive or neural mechanisms, again without making any assumptions about the ‘reality’ of the subject’s experience.

The goal is to create a comprehensive, third-person account of human consciousness that can be studied and tested scientifically.

> [!note]
> It’s worth noting that heterophenomenology is a controversial approach. Critics argue that it sidesteps the hard problem of consciousness, which is to explain why and how subjective experiences arise from physical processes in the brain. Supporters counter that it provides a practical method for studying consciousness scientifically by focusing on phenomena that can be observed and measured objectively.

> - Heterophenomenology treats subjective reports as data to be explained scientifically, without committing to their truth.
> - Standard [[phenomenology]] seeks to uncover the essential structures of consciousness from the inside, focusing on how things appear to the experiencing subject.

> In short: heterophenomenology is an external, scientific method; standard [[phenomenology]] is an internal, descriptive method.
