A knowledge graph is a type of database used to represent the relationships between entities, which can include people, places, things, or concepts. The vertices in the graph represent the entities in the real world, and the edges represent the relationships between those entities.

For example, a knowledge graph may represent the relationships between actors, movies, directors, and genres in the film industry. The actors, movies, directors, and genres are represented as vertices, and the relationships between them (such as “acted in”, “directed”, or “is a genre of”) are represented as edges.
