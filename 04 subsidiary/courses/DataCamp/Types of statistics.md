The two main types of statistics are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

1. **Descriptive statistics** involve methods and techniques used to summarise and describe the main features of data. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation and graphs such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots. Descriptive statistics aim to provide a clear and concise summary of the data.
2. **Inferential statistics** involves techniques used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It includes methods like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics help generalise findings from a sample to a larger population and assess the significance of relationships or differences observed in the data.
