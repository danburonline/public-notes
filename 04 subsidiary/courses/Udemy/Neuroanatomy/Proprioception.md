Proprioception includes the **sense of position and movement of our limbs and muscles.** This permits us to move effortlessly without needing to look at what each body part is doing. For instance, even **with our eyes closed, weâ€™re able to touch our nose with a finger** due to proprioception.

## Overview

1. **Muscle Spindles**: Muscle spindles, located within the muscle fibres, sense muscle stretch and the speed of the stretch, providing information about muscle length and velocity of movement.

2. **Golgi Tendon Organs**: These receptors are in tendons, the tissues connecting muscle to bone. They respond to muscle tension and the rate of tension development, providing a sense of force.

3. **Joint Capsule Receptors**: These receptors provide information about joint angle and joint movement, contributing to the sense of the position of the body and its parts.
