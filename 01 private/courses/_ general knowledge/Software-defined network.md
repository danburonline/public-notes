Software-defined networking (SDN) is a network architecture that separates traditional networking devices’ control and forwarding functions, enabling centralised control and management of the network through software.

- **An example of SDN is the Cloudflare network,** a distributed network of edge servers that provides website content delivery, security, and performance optimisation services.
- The Cloudflare network is software-defined, meaning it’s controlled and managed by software rather than traditional networking devices. This allows Cloudflare to rapidly deploy new services and features and respond quickly to changing network conditions.
- As, e.g. a web developer, you can leverage Cloudflare’s network to improve the performance and security of your website without needing to manage your own complex networking infrastructure.
- With Cloudflare, you can easily configure and manage your website’s network traffic, set up firewalls, and optimise performance, all through a centralised dashboard. This makes Cloudflare a powerful and flexible tool for managing your website’s network infrastructure.
