A Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) is an **investment contract between a startup and an investor that provides rights to the investor for future equity in the company.** SAFE was introduced by Y Combinator in 2013 as a more straightforward, faster, and cheaper alternative to convertible notes.

## Key Features

1. **Equity Rights**: A SAFE investor does not receive equity immediately but gets the right to obtain equity at a later date when a triggering event occurs.
2. **Triggering Events**: Common triggering events include a future equity financing round, acquisition, or IPO.
3. **Valuation Cap**: A maximum company valuation at which the SAFE converts to equity. This protects the investor from excessive dilution.
4. **Discount Rate**: A percentage discount on the price per share at which the SAFE converts to equity in a future financing round, providing additional incentive for early investment.
5. **No Interest or Maturity Date**: Unlike convertible notes, SAFEs do not accrue interest and do not have a maturity date.
6. **Flexibility**: SAFEs can be customised to fit the needs of both the startup and the investor, allowing for different terms and conditions to be set.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity**: SAFEs are easier to understand and execute compared to traditional convertible notes.
- **Speed**: The streamlined nature of SAFEs allows for faster fundraising.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduced legal and administrative costs compared to other equity financing methods.

## Risks and Considerations

- **Investor Uncertainty**: Since there is no fixed date for conversion, investors might wait longer to see their equity realised.
- **Dilution**: Future financing rounds could dilute the equity percentage obtained through a SAFE.
- **Company Valuation**: The valuation cap and discount rate can significantly affect the equity stake the investor ultimately receives.
