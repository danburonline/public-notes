1. **Spatial Intelligence**: The ability to visualise with the mind’s eye and to understand and manipulate spatial fields. It’s often associated with navigation, map reading, and handling objects.
2. **Linguistic Intelligence**: The capacity to use language, your native language, and perhaps other languages, to express what’s on your mind and to understand other people.
3. **Logical-Mathematical Intelligence**: The ability to understand the underlying principles of some causal system the way a scientist or a logician does or can manipulate numbers, quantities, and operations the way a mathematician does.
4. **Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence**: The ability to use the body to create products or solve problems. It involves physical coordination and dexterity, using fine motor skills, and expressing oneself through physical activities.
5. **Musical Intelligence**: The capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognise them, remember them, and perhaps manipulate them.
6. **Interpersonal Intelligence**: The ability to understand other people, what motivates them, how they work, and how to work cooperatively with them.
7. **Intrapersonal Intelligence**: The capacity to understand oneself, to have an effective working model of oneself—including one’s own desires, fears, and capacities—and to use such information effectively in regulating one’s own life.
8. **Naturalist Intelligence**: The ability to discriminate among living things (plants, animals) and sensitivity to other natural world features (clouds, rock configurations).

These types of intelligence are part of the Multiple Intelligences theory proposed by [Howard Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner).

Coming to Fluid and Crystallised Intelligence are two types of cognitive abilities. The concept was proposed by psychologist [Raymond Cattell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Cattell).

**Fluid Intelligence (Gf)**: This refers to the ability to reason and think flexibly. It involves the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, independent of acquired knowledge. Fluid intelligence involves identifying patterns and relationships that underpin novel problems and extrapolating these findings using logic. It is often used in problem-solving where prior knowledge is useless. Fluid intelligence tends to decline during late adulthood.

**Crystallised Intelligence (Gc)**: This refers to the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience. It doesn’t equate to memory, but it does rely on accessing information from long-term memory. Crystallised intelligence is one’s lifetime of intellectual achievement, as demonstrated primarily through one’s vocabulary and general knowledge. This improves as one age, as it is a cumulative measure of knowledge and verbal skills.
