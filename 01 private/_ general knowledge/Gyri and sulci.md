Gyri and sulci are the **ridges and grooves, respectively, on the surface of the brain.** These structures increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex, allowing for greater cognitive function and information processing capacity.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Gyri (Singular: Gyrus)

- **Definition**: Gyri are the raised ridges or folds on the cerebral cortex.
- **Function**: Each gyrus contains multiple layers of neurons involved in processing different types of information.
- **Examples**:
  - **Precentral Gyrus**: Located in the frontal lobe, it contains the primary motor cortex, responsible for voluntary movement.
  - **Postcentral Gyrus**: Located in the parietal lobe, it houses the primary somatosensory cortex, which processes sensory information from the body.

### 2. Sulci (Singular: Sulcus)

- **Definition**: Sulci are the grooves or fissures between the gyri on the brainâ€™s surface.
- **Function**: Sulci separate different brain regions and allow for the compact organisation of neural tissues.
- **Examples**:
  - **Central Sulcus**: Separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe.
  - **Lateral Sulcus (Sylvian Fissure)**: Separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes.
  - **Parieto-Occipital Sulcus**: Separates the parietal lobe from the occipital lobe.
