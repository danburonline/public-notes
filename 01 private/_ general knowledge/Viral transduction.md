Viral transduction is a **method to introduce genetic material into cells using viral vectors**. It is widely used in neuroscience to manipulate gene expression in specific cell types, enabling the study of genes and neural circuits.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Viral Vectors

- **Adeno-associated Virus (AAV)**: Infects both dividing and non-dividing cells, low immunogenicity.
- **Lentivirus**: Integrates into the host genome for long-term expression.
- **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**: High capacity for gene delivery and efficient neuron infection.

### 2. Mechanism

- **Gene Delivery**: Viral vectors introduce genes into target cells for protein expression.
- **Specificity**: Cell-type-specific promoters target expression to specific neurons.

## Example: [[Optogenetics]]

Optogenetics uses light to control genetically modified neurons expressing light-sensitive ion channels.

### Channelrhodopsin (ChR2)

- **Function**: Blue light (470 nm) activates ChR2, depolarising and activating neurons.
- **Application**: Viral transduction introduces ChR2 into neurons, allowing precise control of activation with blue light.

### Halorhodopsin (NpHR)

- **Function**: Yellow light (590 nm) activates NpHR, hyperpolarising and inhibiting neurons.
- **Application**: Viral transduction introduces NpHR into neurons, enabling precise inhibition with yellow light.

## Applications of Optogenetics

- **Neural Circuit Mapping**: Selective activation/inhibition of neurons to map circuits.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Control of neuronal activity during behaviour experiments.
- **Disease Models**: Studying neuron activation/inhibition in disease models for therapeutic insights.
