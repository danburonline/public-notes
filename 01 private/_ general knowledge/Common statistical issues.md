- Have the author’s considered possible sources of bias?
- Using parametric tests when your data or residuals are not normally distributed
- Treating non-independent samples with methods for analysing independent samples
- Not making corrections for multiple comparisons to find true significance (e.g. Bonferroni correction)
- Ignoring clustering, grouping or hierarchical ordering in your data – hierarchical or multilevel analyses might be necessary
- Failure to analyse the differences in effect sizes between groups correctly
