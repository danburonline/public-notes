Personalised regenerative medicine is a medical approach that uses an individual’s biological material, such as cells or tissues, to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissue. This approach is based on the idea that using a person’s own cells or tissues can reduce the risk of rejection or adverse effects compared to using foreign substances. Personalised regenerative medicine can be tailored to a patient’s specific needs and may involve stem cells, gene therapy, tissue engineering, or other techniques.
