  Platonic Realism (also known as Platonic Idealism) is a theory developed by the ancient Greek philosophe, Plato. This theory is based on the concept of **“Forms”** or **“Ideas”**, which are abstract, perfect, and immutable entities that exist independently of the sensible world.

## Key Principles

1. **Existence of Universals**: Platonic Realism posits that universals or abstract objects exist. These can include things like numbers, geometrical shapes, ethical values, qualities such as redness or beauty, etc.

2. **Independence**: These universals are independent of the mind and the material world. They would exist even if there were no minds to conceive of them and no physical objects to instantiate them.

3. **Knowledge of Universals**: According to Plato, we can have knowledge of these universals. This knowledge is gained not through empirical observation but through a kind of intellectual intuition or recollection.

## Example

For example, take the concept of a triangle. In Platonic Realism, there exists a perfect “Form” of a triangle, an abstract entity that possesses all the properties of a triangle. All particular instances of triangles in the physical world are merely imperfect copies of this perfect Form.

## Key Debates

One of the main debates surrounding Platonic Realism is the interaction between these abstract Forms and the physical world. How can we, as physical beings, have knowledge of these abstract, perfect, and independent Forms? Plato’s theory of recollection attempts to answer this, suggesting that our souls knew these Forms before birth and that learning is a process of recollecting this knowledge.
