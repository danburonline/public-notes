The “beer test” was a technique that **Steve Jobs used to interview potential employees** for Apple. Instead of the traditional formal interview in a boardroom, **Jobs would take the candidate for a walk and then have a beer with them.** The goal of the beer test was to see if Jobs would enjoy spending time with the candidate outside of work. He wanted to know if they were someone he could get along with and have a conversation with.
