1. **Understanding Team Members:** Understanding how each team member’s role aligns with their life goals is crucial. This includes developing real human relationships that evolve as people change.
2. **Role Assignment:** Challenge and position your team members in roles that will significantly affect their emotions, income, career growth, and overall life satisfaction. It’s about cultivating people on both steep and gradual growth trajectories.
3. **Superstar vs. Rockstar Modes:**
    - **Rockstar Mode:** People in this mode are incredibly reliable (think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen). They’re passionate about their work and have found their niche. They value consistency and mastery over their craft and don’t aspire to positions that would distract them from it.
    - **Superstar Mode:** People in this mode are ambitious and thrive on constant challenges and growth opportunities.
4. **Growth Trajectories:**
    - **Steep Growth:** Characterised by rapid change, including swift acquisition of new skills or deepening of existing ones. This growth is not exclusively tied to managerial roles or promotions but is generally associated with increasing impact over time.
    - **Gradual Growth:** Characterised by stability and incremental improvements, it typically applies to individuals who have mastered their roles.
5. **Role Suitability:** Rock-star mode individuals may be better suited for roles requiring steadiness, accumulated knowledge, and attention to detail. Superstar-mode individuals may lack the patience for these roles and are better suited for roles that offer continuous challenges and growth opportunities.
6. **Role Satisfaction:** Individuals will be discontent if placed in a role that does not align with their current mode. Superstars won’t thrive in rock star roles, and vice versa.
