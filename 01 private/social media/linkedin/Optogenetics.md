Optogenetics is a field of neuroscience that involves **using light to control the activity of specific neurons in living tissue.** It combines genetic techniques and optics to render selected neurons sensitive to light. Researchers can selectively activate or inhibit these neurons with precise timing by using specialised proteins called opsin that are sensitive to light. Optogenetics allows scientists to study the function of specific neural circuits and understand their contributions to behaviour and disease.
