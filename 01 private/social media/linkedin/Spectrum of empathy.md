1. **Pity:** This is the most basic level of empathy, where one person feels sorry for the other’s suffering. It can be seen as a somewhat detached form of empathy, as it doesn’t require fully understanding or sharing the other person’s feelings. Rather, it’s recognising their distress and expressing sorrow for it. However, pity can sometimes be seen as patronising or condescending, as it implies a certain level of superiority from the person expressing it.

2. **Sympathy:** Sympathy goes one step further than pity. It refers to the ability to understand someone else’s situation, misfortune, or suffering. While sympathy involves feelings of care and concern, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re sharing in their emotional experience. It’s more of acknowledging their pain rather than attempting to feel it along with them.

3. **Empathy:** Empathy represents a deeper level of emotional engagement. It’s about truly understanding and sharing another person’s feelings. This often means putting yourself in their shoes and seeing things from their perspective. Empathy creates a deeper emotional connection and often leads to a stronger sense of understanding and support.

4. **Compassion:** Compassion is the pinnacle of this spectrum. It is empathy put into action. Not only does it involve understanding and sharing someone else’s feelings, but it also includes a desire to alleviate their suffering. Compassion can lead to acts of kindness and support as it moves beyond feeling and understanding into doing. It represents a full emotional engagement with the person’s suffering and a proactive stance toward relieving it.
