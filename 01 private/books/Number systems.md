In mathematics, numbers are classified into various categories based on their properties. These categories are known as number systems. Let’s discuss the main number systems.

## Natural Numbers

Natural numbers are the counting numbers starting from 1. They are used for counting and ordering. The set of natural numbers is denoted by `N`. For example, `N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …}`.

## Whole Numbers

Whole numbers are natural numbers, including zero. They are also used for counting and ordering. The set of whole numbers is denoted by `W`. For example, `W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …}`.

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers, including negative natural numbers. They are used to represent quantities that can increase or decrease. The set of integers is denoted by `Z`. For example, `Z = {…, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}`.

## Rational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers where the denominator is not zero. This includes all integers, as an integer can be expressed as the ratio of the integer to one. The set of rational numbers is denoted by `Q`. For example, `1/2`, `3/4`, `7` (which is 7/1), and `0` (which is 0/1) are all rational numbers.

## Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. These numbers often come from square roots of non-perfect squares or certain transcendental numbers like `π` or `e`. For example, √2, π, and e are all irrational numbers.

## Real Numbers

Real numbers encompass both rational and irrational numbers. This means every number that can be placed on the number line is a real number. The set of real numbers is denoted by `R`. It includes all numbers without an imaginary component.

## Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are numbers that consist of a real part and an imaginary part. They are expressed in the form of `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `i` is the imaginary unit with the property `i² = -1`. The set of complex numbers is denoted by `C`.

## Imaginary Numbers

Imaginary numbers are a subset of complex numbers. They can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit `i`, where `i` is the imaginary unit with the property `i² = -1`. For example, `2i` and `3i` are imaginary numbers.
