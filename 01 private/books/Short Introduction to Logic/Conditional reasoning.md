Conditional reasoning is a cognitive process that involves **making inferences or deductions from certain information under specific “conditions”** or “if-then” scenarios. It’s a key part of logical thinking and problem-solving.

## Structure of Conditional Statements

Conditional statements consist of two parts:

- **Antecedent**: The ‘if’ part of the statement
- **Consequent**: The ‘then’ part of the statement

Example: In the statement “If it rains, then the ground will be wet,” “it rains” is the antecedent and “the ground will be wet” is the consequent.

## Types of Conditional Reasoning

There are four types of conditional reasoning:

1. **Modus Ponens (Affirming the Antecedent)**: If the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.
	*Example:* If it is raining (and we know this is true), then the ground is wet.

2. **Modus Tollens (Denying the Consequent)**: If the consequent is not true, then the antecedent is also not true.
    *Example:* If the ground is not wet (and we know this is true), then it is not raining.

3. **Affirmation of the Consequent (Fallacy)**: If the consequent is true, it does not necessarily mean the antecedent is true.
    *Example:* If the ground is wet (and we know this is true), it does not necessarily mean it rained because there might be other reasons for the ground to be wet.

4. **Denial of the Antecedent (Fallacy)**: If the antecedent is not true, it does not necessarily mean the consequent is not true.
    *Example:* If it is not raining (and we know this is true), it does not necessarily mean the ground is not wet because there might be other reasons for the ground to be wet.
