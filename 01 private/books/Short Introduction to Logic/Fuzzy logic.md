Fuzzy logic is a form of **many-valued logic where the truth values of variables can be any real number between 0 and 1.** It’s used to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.

## Key Points

- Fuzzy logic is different from classical or Boolean logic, which asserts that everything can be expressed in binary terms of 0 (false) or 1 (true). Fuzzy logic allows for values in between.
- Fuzzy logic is used to control systems that are difficult to model precisely but about which we have a general understanding.
- Applications of fuzzy logic include automatic gearboxes, air conditioners, washing machines, weather forecasting systems, medical diagnosis and treatment plans, and stock trading systems.

## Example

Consider a temperature control system that uses fuzzy logic:

1. The input is the current temperature, and the output is the desired fan speed.
2. The temperature value is converted into fuzzy sets like “Cold”, “Warm”, and “Hot”. Each of these sets is defined by a membership function which maps the degree of membership for each temperature value to the set.
3. The fuzzy logic system then uses a set of rules like “If (Temperature is Hot) then (Fan Speed is High)” to determine the appropriate fan speed for the current temperature.
4. The resulting fan speed is then defuzzified back into a crisp value to control the fan. The defuzzification process often involves taking a weighted average of the fuzzy set values.
