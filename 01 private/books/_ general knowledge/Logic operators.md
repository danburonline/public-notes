- **NOT (¬)**: This is a unary operator, meaning it operates on a single logical value. NOT p (¬p) is true if p is false, and vice versa.
- **AND (∧)**: This is a binary operator, meaning it operates on two logical values. p AND q (p ∧ q) is true if and only if both p and q are true.
- **OR (∨)**: This is also a binary operator. p OR q (p ∨ q) is true if either p is true, q is true, or both p and q are true.
- **IF...THEN (→)**: This is a binary operator. IF p THEN q (p → q) is true unless p is true and q is false. It is also known as 'implies' or 'conditional'.
- **IF AND ONLY IF (↔)**: This is a binary operator. p IF AND ONLY IF q (p ↔ q) is true if both p and q have the same truth value. It is also known as biconditional or equivalence.
- **XOR (⊕)**: This is a binary operator. p XOR q (p ⊕ q) is true if p and q have different truth values. That is, it's true if either p is true and q is false, or p is false, and q is true. It is also known as 'exclusive or'.
- **NAND (↑)**: This is a binary operator. p NAND q (p ↑ q) is true if at least one of p or q is false. It is the logical negation of AND, hence the name (Not AND).
- **NOR (↓)**: This is a binary operator. p NOR q (p ↓ q) is true if both p and q are false. It is the logical negation of OR, hence the name (Not OR).
- **IMPLICATION (⇒)**: This is a binary operator, similar to 'IF...THEN'. p IMPLIES q (p ⇒ q) is true unless p is true and q is false. In other words, it's false only when p is true and q is false.
- **EQUIVALENCE (⇔)**: This is a binary operator, just like 'IF AND ONLY IF'. p EQUIVALENT TO q (p ⇔ q) is true if both p and q have the same truth value (both true or both false). This is also known as 'if and only if' or 'biconditional'.
- **MATERIAL NONIMPLICATION (↛)**: This is a binary operator. p DOES NOT IMPLY q (p ↛ q) is true if and only if p is true and q is false. It's the logical negation of 'IMPLICATION'.
- **MATERIAL IMPLICATION (↚)**: This is a binary operator. p IS NOT IMPLIED BY q (p ↚ q) is true if and only if p is false and q is true. It's the logical counterpart to 'DOES NOT IMPLY'.
- **CONVERSE NONIMPLICATION (⇎)**: This is a binary operator. p IS NOT IMPLIED BY q (p ⇎ q) is true if and only if p is true and q is false. It's the logical counterpart to 'IS NOT IMPLIED BY'.
- **POSSIBILITY (◇)**: This operator is often visually represented as a diamond, but it stands for the concept of 'Possibly'. When it precedes a statement, it means that the statement could be true. For example, if P is a statement, ◇P means "It is possible that P is true".
- **NECESSITY (□)**: This operator is often visually represented as a square, but it stands for the concept of 'Necessarily'. When it precedes a statement, it means that the statement must be true. For example, if P is a statement, □P means "It is necessary that P is true" or "P is true in all possible worlds".
