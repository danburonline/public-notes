Radical empiricism is a philosophical approach that emphasises the primacy of sensory experience and rejects the notion that knowledge can be derived solely from reason or intuition. It was developed by American philosopher [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. James argued that reality is a continuous stream of experience and that knowledge is derived from the direct observation and interpretation of that experience. He also emphasised the importance of subjective experience and the role of the individual in shaping reality.
