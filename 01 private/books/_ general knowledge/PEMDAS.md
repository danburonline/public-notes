PEMDAS stands for **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication, **D**ivision, **A**ddition, and **S**ubtraction and is the order of operations used when solving mathematical equations. When using PEMDAS, it is important to remember that parentheses must be solved first, followed by exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).
