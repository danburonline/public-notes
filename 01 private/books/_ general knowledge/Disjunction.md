In logic, a **disjunction** is a compound statement formed by joining two or more statements with the word ‘or’.

The disjunction “P or Q” is true if at least one of the component statements (P, Q) is true. In other words, if either P is true, Q is true, or both P and Q are true, then “P or Q” is true. If both P and Q are false, then the disjunction “P or Q” is false.

For example, consider the statements:

1. P: “It is raining.”
2. Q: “I will stay indoors.”

The disjunction of these statements would be: “It is raining, or I will stay indoors.”

If it’s true that “It is raining,” or it’s true that “I will stay indoors,” or both statements are true, then the entire disjunction is true. If both statements are false (it is not raining, and I will not stay indoors), then the disjunction is false.
