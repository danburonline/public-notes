Cephalisation is the **process of concentrating sensory organs, nerve cells, and muscle cells in the head region of an organism.** This process is seen in many animals, from simple organisms like worms to more complex organisms like humans and other mammals. It is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation that allows animals to process sensory information better and respond to their environment. Cephalisation is also associated with increased intelligence, as the concentration of nerve cells in the head region allows for more complex behaviours.
