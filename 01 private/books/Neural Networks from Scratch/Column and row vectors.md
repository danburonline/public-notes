## Column Vectors

- **Structure**: Consists of a single column with multiple rows.
- **Notation Example**:

  $$
\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix}
$$
- **Usage in Mathematics**:
  - It is commonly used in linear algebra to represent vectors in $n$-dimensional space.
  - Used in matrix multiplication, where they can be multiplied with matrices to transform the vector.

## Row Vectors

- **Structure**: Consists of a single row with multiple columns.
- **Notation Example**:
  
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_n
  \end{bmatrix}
$$
- **Usage in Mathematics**:
  - Often appear as transposed column vectors.
  - Used in different contexts compared to column vectors, like representing coefficients in a linear equation.

## Comparisons and Interactions

- **Transpose Operations**:
  - The transpose of a row vector is a column vector and vice versa.
- **Matrix Multiplication**:
  - Row vectors are often seen in the context of multiplying from the left of a matrix.
  - Column vectors are typically multiplied from the right.

> [!tip] Applications
> - **Linear Transformations**:
>   Both types are used to describe linear transformations, but their orientation affects how they interact with matrices.
> - **Coordinate Systems:**
>  Row vectors can represent coordinates in a different way than column vectors, impacting how transformations are applied.
