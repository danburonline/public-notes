The Z-Score, also known as a standard score, is **a statistic that tells you how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.** It’s a measure of how unusual or typical a particular data point is within a data set.

## Definition

The Z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean of a data set from an individual data point and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the data set.

The formula to calculate the Z-score is:

```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```

where:

- `Z` is the Z-score,
- `X` is the value of the individual data point,
- `μ` is the mean of the population, and
- `σ` is the standard deviation of the population.

## Key Points

- **Data Point (X)**: Your data set’s individual observation or value.
- [[Sample vs population|Population]] [[Binomial distribution#Mean and Variance|Mean]] (μ)**: The average value of a particular measurement across the entire population.
- **Population Standard [[Variance and standard deviation#Standard Deviation|Deviation]] (σ)**: The amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values in the population.

## Interpretation

- A Z-score of 0 indicates that the data point’s score is identical to the mean score.
- A Z-score of 1.0 indicates a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score above the mean and a negative score below the mean.

## Usage

Z-scores are especially useful in research, as they allow scientists to calculate the probability of a score occurring within a given data set and compare two scores from different samples (which may have different means and standard deviations).

> [!example]
> For example, consider a student who scores 85 on a math test. The class mean μ is 70, and the standard deviation σ is 10. The Z-score for the student’s 85 score would be:
> 
> ```
> Z = (85 - 70) / 10 = 1.5
> ```
> 
> This Z-score tells us that the student’s score was 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.
