Symbolic computation, also known as symbolic computing or computer algebra, is a branch of computer science that focuses on manipulating mathematical expressions in symbolic form.

## Key Points

- **Precision over approximation**: Unlike numerical computation, which approximates mathematical quantities as floating-point numbers, symbolic computation keeps the mathematical quantities in their symbolic form as long as possible. For example, âˆš2 would be `sqrt(2)` in symbolic computation, not `1.41421356`.

- **Capabilities**: Symbolic computation allows for simplification of mathematical expressions, exact arithmetic, computation of derivatives and integrals of functions, solving algebraic equations exactly, and manipulation and solving of differential equations.

- **Tools**: Popular programming languages and systems for symbolic computation include `Wolfram Mathematica`, `Maple`, and the Python library `SymPy`.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Exact results**: Symbolic computation can provide exact results, whereas numerical computation would only provide an approximation.

- **Manipulation of expressions**: It can handle manipulations that are difficult or impossible with numerical methods.

### Cons

- **Speed**: Symbolic computation can be slower than numerical computation, especially for large problems.

- **Limitations**: Some problems have no symbolic solution, requiring a numerical approximation instead.
