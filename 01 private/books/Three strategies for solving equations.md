1. **Explicit Solutions:** This is the best-case scenario where a general formula in terms of known functions can be found to solve the equations. While these exact solutions are rare, they are extremely valuable due to their precise representation of known quantities.

2. **Approximation Methods:** When explicit solutions are not feasible, reasonable approximations within a defined range can be used. These methods, including asymptotic or perturbative techniques, are a cornerstone of applied mathematics and allow for information extraction from seemingly unsolvable equations. The effectiveness of these methods lies in their application by skilled mathematicians.

3. **Numerical Solutions:** The third approach involves solving equations numerically using computer algorithms. These algorithms can generate numerical solutions by assigning specific values to all variables and parameters. This technique has revolutionised mathematical problem-solving and has greatly benefited from advances in computer processing power and algorithmic design over the past six decades. It is particularly effective for systems of equations with thousands to millions of variables and is deeply intertwined with modern applied mathematics and computer science progress.
