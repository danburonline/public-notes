## 1. GRADUAL REPLACEMENT PROCEDURES

### 1.1. Essentially-in-place procedures

#### 1.1.1. In-place destructive procedures

- **1.1.1.1. In-place destructive conscious nanobot replacement**: Nanobots replace neurons while maintaining consciousness, with variations in the speed (`Neurons/second (n/s)`) and method (`Neuron-batches`) of replacement.
  - **1.1.1.1.1. Spectrum of temporal rates**: The replacement can occur at different speeds, impacting the continuity of consciousness.
  - **1.1.1.1.2. Spectrum of spatial displacements**: The physical location of neurons can be altered during the replacement process.
  - **1.1.1.1.3. Nondestructive brain-doubling**: A duplicate, non-biological brain is created without destroying the original.
  - **1.1.1.1.4. Delayed destructive brain-doubling**: The original brain is preserved until the duplicate brain is fully operational.

#### 1.1.2. In-place nondestructive procedures

- **1.1.2.1. In-place nondestructive conscious nanobot brain-doubling**: Similar to 1.1.1.1.3 but focuses on maintaining consciousness throughout the process.
  - **1.1.2.1.1. Brain-doubling with temporary biological shutdown**: Involves a temporary halt in biological brain activity to facilitate duplication.
  - **1.1.2.1.2. In-place delayed destructive conscious nanobot replacement**: The original brain’s functions are gradually transferred to a non-biological substrate before its destruction.

### 1.2. Non-in-place procedures

- **1.2.1. Moravec bush-robot**: Utilizes a robotic mechanism to replace brain functions, potentially allowing for a non-destructive transition.

## 2. SCAN-AND-DUPLICATE PROCEDURES

### 2.1. Frozen scan-and-copy procedures

- **2.1.1. Frozen destructive scan-and-copy**: The biological brain is destructively scanned to create a digital or physical replica, with variations based on the replica’s nature (`Physical biological brain`, `Physical computerized brain`, `Virtual structural brain`, `Virtual functional brain`, `Virtual higher-order brain`).
- **2.1.2. Frozen nondestructive scan-and-copy**: The original brain is preserved, and a duplicate is created, considering the sensory environment’s role in awakening both brains.

### 2.2. [[Multiple realisability#Implications in Consciousness Research|Conscious]] scan-and-copy procedures

- **2.2.1. Conscious destructive**: Involves scanning the brain while conscious, leading to either immediate (`Teleportation`) or gradual duplication.
- **2.2.2. Conscious nondestructive**: The brain is scanned without destruction, considering the immediacy of the scan and the sensory environment of the upload’s reception.

## 3. BRAIN DIVISION PROCEDURES

- **3.1. - 3.7.**: These techniques involve dividing the brain’s functions or structure at varying percentages and frequencies, questioning identity and continuity during the transfer process.
