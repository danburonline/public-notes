A soliton wave is a solitary wave that is characterised by a single peak and a single trough. It is a type of nonlinear wave that maintains its shape as it propagates through a medium. It is also known as a solitary wave or a solitary wave-like pulse. Soliton waves can be found in many different physical systems, including water waves, optical fibres, and plasma physics. Soliton waves are important in many areas of physics, such as fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and quantum mechanics.
