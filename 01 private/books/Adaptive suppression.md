Adaptive suppression refers to a technique or process that **dynamically adjusts or modulates the suppression or reduction of unwanted signals or noise in a system.** It involves continuously monitoring the input or environment and automatically adapting the suppression parameters or algorithms in order to enhance the desired signals while minimising the impact of interference or noise.

This adaptive approach allows for more effective and efficient suppression performance, as it can adapt to changing conditions and optimise the trade-off between signal preservation and noise reduction. Adaptive suppression is commonly used in various fields, including audio processing, communication systems, image and video processing, and the brain.
