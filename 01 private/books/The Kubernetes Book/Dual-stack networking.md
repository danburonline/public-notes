Dual stack networking is a **transition technology for the migration from IPv4 to IPv6.** It allows devices to support both IPv4 and IPv6, facilitating communication across networks that use either protocol.

## Key Concepts

### **IPv4**

- Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) utilises a 32-bit address space.
- Allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- The rapid growth of the internet has led to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses.

### **IPv6**

- Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) utilises a 128-bit address space.
- Provides a significantly larger number of unique addresses (around 3.4x10^38).
- IPv6 was developed to overcome the limitations of IPv4.

## Working of Dual Stack Networks

1. Devices in a dual-stack network are configured with both an IPv4 address and IPv6 address.
2. When a dual-stack device (source) wants to communicate with another device (destination), it checks the destination device's capability.
3. If the destination device supports IPv6, the source device sends an IPv6 packet.
4. If the destination device only supports IPv4, the source device sends an IPv4 packet.
5. This allows the source device to communicate with both IPv4-only and IPv6-capable devices.

## Benefits

- Ensures uninterrupted internet services during the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.
- Allows network operators to deploy IPv6 in their networks gradually.

## Challenges

- Managing a dual-stack network can be complex and resource-intensive, requiring managing and operating two separate protocol stacks.
