The **Synthetic Neural Substrate Sequential Layering Transfer for Cognitive Preservation** (SNSSLT-CP) is a hypothetical procedure envisioned to seamlessly transition encoded neural information from a biological to a synthetic substrate, ensuring the preservation of cognitive functions and personal identity. This is pursued with the ultimate goal of enabling simulated reality experiences through embedded electrode technology.

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**:
    - Develop a synthetic neural substrate using 3D bioprinting technology to create brain organoids.
    - Integrate electrode arrays within the synthetic neural substrate to facilitate neuron-level read and stimulation capabilities.
    - Prepare the biological brain for the procedure by mapping its neural architecture.
2. **Sequential Layering [[Moravec transfer|Transfer]]**:
    - Lay down a layer of synthetic neural tissue atop the corresponding section of the biological neural tissue.
    - Facilitate natural or induced connections between the neurons of the biological tissue and the synthetic layer.
    - Initiate a controlled termination of the biological neural tissue layer, prompting the transfer of neural information to the synthetic substrate.
    - Monitor the transfer process to ensure complete information transition and verify the functionality of the synthetic neural layer.
    - Repeat this process layer by layer until the entire biological brain’s information is transitioned to the synthetic substrate.
3. **Cognitive Preservation Verification**:
    - Utilise the integrated electrode arrays to perform comprehensive testing to ensure cognitive functions and personal identity have been preserved.
    - Conduct simulated reality testing to verify the synthetic brain’s functionality and the individual’s ability to interact with simulated environments.
4. **Simulated Reality Engagement**:
    - Utilise the electrode technology to facilitate immersive simulated reality experiences.
    - Monitor and assess the individual’s interaction within simulated environments, ensuring a seamless transition from biological to synthetic cognitive functioning.

This procedure, SNSSLT-CP, hypothetically offers a potential solution for cognitive preservation and the exploration of simulated realities, therefore achieving “mind uploading”.
