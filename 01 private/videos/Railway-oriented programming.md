Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) is a functional programming concept initially introduced and popularised by [Scott Wlaschin](https://scottwlaschin.com/). It's named "Railway Oriented Programming" because it likens a program's flow to a model railway: data flows along a track, and at each railway switch, it may be directed onto the "success" track or the "failure" track.

ROP is primarily about error handling in a functional, composable, and type-safe way. It focuses on the principle that a function should return either a valid result or a meaningful failure rather than throw an exception, which must be handled separately.

Below is an example of how you might write Railway Oriented Programming in Python, using the `Result` type from the `dry-python/returns` library. This library provides types and primitives for writing type-safe code in Python.

```python
from returns.result import Result, Success, Failure

def divide(numerator: int, denominator: int) -> Result[float, str]:
    if denominator == 0:
        return Failure('Cannot divide by zero')
    else:
        return Success(numerator / denominator)

# Usage
result = divide(10, 2)

if isinstance(result, Success):
    print('Result:', result.unwrap())
else:
    print('Error:', result.failure())
```

In this example, the `divide` function returns a `Result` type, either a `Success` or a `Failure`. This allows the caller to handle success and failure cases in a consistent and type-safe without worrying about exceptions being thrown.

It's worth noting that Python, being a dynamically typed language, doesn't enforce type safety to the extent that statically typed languages do. As such, Railway Oriented Programming is more commonly used in statically typed functional programming languages like F#, Haskell, and Elm.

**Remember, in Railway Oriented Programming:**
- Functions return either a 'Success' path with the result or a 'Failure' path with the error.
- You can chain several functions together, where each function can potentially return an error.
- If any function in this chain fails, processing skips all remaining functions and carries the failure to the end.
- This way, the error handling code is separated from the success path code, enhancing readability and maintainability.
