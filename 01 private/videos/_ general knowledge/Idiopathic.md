Idiopathic refers to a medical condition or **disease that arises spontaneously or whose cause is unknown.** It is derived from the Greek words “idios”, meaning “one’s own”, and “pathos”, meaning “suffering.” When a condition is labelled as idiopathic, it means that medical professionals cannot identify a specific underlying cause or trigger for the symptoms or disease. Despite extensive investigations and tests, the precise origin remains uncertain.
