The concept of the distributed brain highlights that **brain functions are not confined to isolated regions. Instead, various areas contribute** to even the simplest behaviours and cognitive tasks.

## Key Points

- **Brain Function Distribution:** Multiple brain areas are involved in what appear to be simple behaviours.
- **Neuronal Orchestration:** Neurons across different regions hierarchically coordinate behaviours, both anatomically and computationally.

## A “Simple” Example: Playing Tennis

- **[Visual](../../kings%20college/02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Visual%20search.md) Cortex:** Engaged in judging the tennis ball’s size, motion, and velocity.
- **Amygdala and Brainstem:** Adjust heart rate and respiration; work with the hypothalamus to motivate.
- **Premotor and Motor Cortex:** Involved in signalling the spinal cord to hit the ball.
- **[Basal ganglia](../../kings%20college/04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Basal%20ganglia.md):** Activated to recall learned movements, contributing to muscle memory.
- **Cerebellum, Parietal and Somatosensory Cortex:** Provide a sense of the body’s position and feedback on movement.
- **Hippocampus:** Responsible for memory functions, like remembering successful hits for later recall or storytelling.
