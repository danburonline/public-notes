The olfactory bulb is a critical component of the human brain and is **responsible for the sense of smell (olfaction).** It serves as the **first neural processing stage of olfactory information coming from the nose** and plays a pivotal role in the perception and interpretation of odours.

## Structure and Location

- The olfactory bulb is located at the base of the brain, just above the nasal cavity.
- It is part of the olfactory system and is connected to the nasal epithelium via the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I).
- Structurally, the olfactory bulb comprises several layers, including the glomerular layer, where initial odour processing occurs, and the mitral cell layer, which is involved in further processing and transmitting information to other brain areas.

## Function

1. **Odour Detection and Processing:**
   - The olfactory bulb receives input from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the nasal epithelium. Each ORN expresses a specific olfactory receptor that responds to certain odour molecules.
   - Once odour molecules bind to receptors, the ORNs send signals to the olfactory bulb, where they are processed and interpreted.
2. **Odor Discrimination:**
   - The olfactory bulb has the ability to distinguish between a vast array of different odour molecules. This discrimination is facilitated by the specific patterns of neuronal activation in response to different odours.
3. **Signal Relay to Higher Brain Centers:**
   - After initial processing in the olfactory bulb, odour information is relayed to higher brain regions, including the piriform cortex, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, which are involved in odour recognition, emotional response, and memory formation, respectively.
