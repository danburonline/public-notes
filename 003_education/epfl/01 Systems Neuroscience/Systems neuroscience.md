Systems neuroscience is a pivotal branch within the field of neuroscience, **concentrating on the dynamics of neural circuits and how these networks underpin behaviours, perceptions, and emotions.** This discipline seeks to decode the complex interactions between neural activity and the various functionalities such as sensory processing, motor control, and cognitive operations.

## Key Focus of Systems Neuroscience

- Investigates how different parts of the nervous system communicate and collaborate to execute complex behaviours and cognitive functions.
- Employs methodologies like electrophysiology, neuroimaging, computational modelling, and behavioural experiments.
- Aims to understand the operations of neural systems across different scales, from small networks of neurons to large-scale brain systems.

## Comparison with Other Neuroscience Disciplines

1. **Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience**
   - Focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neural function.
   - Systems neuroscience, in contrast, explores how these cellular and molecular components interact and form networks to support complex behaviours.
2. **Cognitive Neuroscience**
   - Concentrates on the neural bases of mental processes such as memory, attention, and language.
   - Overlaps with systems neuroscience in studying brain activity supporting cognitive functions but often uses functional neuroimaging to link brain activity with cognitive processes directly.
3. **Developmental Neuroscience**
   - Studies the development of the nervous system from embryonic stages through adulthood.
   - This provides insights into the formation of neural circuits, which are of interest to systems neuroscience because of their functional outcomes.
4. **Computational Neuroscience**
   - Uses mathematical models and theoretical approaches to understand brain function.
   - It overlaps with systems neuroscience in modelling neural circuits and understanding their computational principles, although it can address issues across various levels of neuroscience.
5. **Behavioural Neuroscience (Biopsychology)**
   - Explores the relationship between the brain, behaviour, and psychological processes.
   - Shares an interest in linking neural activity with behavior, like systems neuroscience, but often emphasises the evolutionary and physiological aspects of behavior more intensely.
