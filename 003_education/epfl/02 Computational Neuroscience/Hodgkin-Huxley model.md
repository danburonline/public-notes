The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a **mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated.** It is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximate the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons.

## Key Components

The model is based on the concept of the neuron as an electrical circuit, which includes:

- **Membrane capacitance (C)**: Represents the ability of the neuron membrane to store charge.
- **Ion conductances (g)**: These are variable and depend on voltage; they determine how easily ions can flow across the membrane.
- **Ion equilibrium potentials (E)**: The voltage at which there is no net flow of a particular ion across the membrane.

## Gating Variables

Ion channels are gated by variables that change with voltage and time, reflecting the probability of a channel being open or closed. There are three main gating variables:

- **n**: Potassium channel activation gate
- **m**: Sodium channel activation gate
- **h**: Sodium channel inactivation gate

These variables obey first-order kinetics and are described by their rate constants for opening (\(\alpha\)) and closing (\(\beta\)).

## Equations

The fundamental equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model include:

1. **[[Resting membrane potential|Membrane]] equation:**

   $$ C \frac{dV}{dt} = I - (g_{Na} m^3 h (V - E_{Na}) + g_{K} n^4 (V - E_{K}) + g_{L} (V - E_{L})) $$

2. **Gating variables**:

   $$ \frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha_n(V) (1-n) - \beta_n(V) n $$

   $$ \frac{dm}{dt} = \alpha_m(V) (1-m) - \beta_m(V) m $$

   $$ \frac{dh}{dt} = \alpha_h(V) (1-h) - \beta_h(V) h $$

3. **Rate constants**:
   - For $n$:

     $$ \alpha_n(V) = 0.01 \frac{V + 55}{1 - e^{-\frac{V + 55}{10}}} $$

     $$ \beta_n(V) = 0.125 e^{-\frac{V + 65}{80}} $$

   - For $m$:

     $$ \alpha_m(V) = 0.1 \frac{V + 40}{1 - e^{-\frac{V + 40}{10}}} $$

     $$ \beta_m(V) = 4 e^{-\frac{V + 65}{18}} $$

   - For $h$:

     $$ \alpha_h(V) = 0.07 e^{-\frac{V + 65}{20}} $$

     $$ \beta_h(V) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\frac{V + 35}{10}}} $$

4. **Currents**:
   - Sodium current $I_{Na}$:

     $$ I_{Na} = g_{Na} m^3 h (V - E_{Na}) $$

   - Potassium current $I_{K}$:

     $$ I_{K} = g_{K} n^4 (V - E_{K}) $$

   - Leakage current $I_{L}$:

     $$ I_{L} = g_{L} (V - E_{L}) $$
