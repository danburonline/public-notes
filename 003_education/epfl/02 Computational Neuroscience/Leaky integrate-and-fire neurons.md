The [[Activation functions overview#Leaky ReLU|Leaky]] Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model is a **simplified version of a neuron used in computational neuroscience.** It captures the essential features of neuronal activity and is computationally less complex than the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]].

## Core Concept

In the LIF model, a neuron is represented as a simple electrical circuit with a capacitor (representing the cell membrane) in parallel with a resistor (the membrane’s resistance to the flow of current). The neuron integrates incoming signals and generates an output (a ‘fire’) when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold.

## Equations

The dynamics of the membrane potential $V$ in the LIF model are described by:

$$ \tau_m \frac{dV}{dt} = - (V - V_{rest}) + R_m I_e $$

where:

- $\tau_m = R_m C_m$ is the membrane time constant,
- $R_m$ is the membrane resistance,
- $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance,
- $V_{rest}$ is the resting membrane potential,
- $I_e$ is the external current.

When $V$ reaches the threshold voltage $V_{threshold}$, the neuron fires an action potential, and $V$ is reset to the resting potential $V_{rest}$

## Fire and Reset

The ‘fire’ condition is represented as:

$$ \text{if } V \geq V_{threshold} \text{, then } V \leftarrow V_{reset} $$
