Spinogenesis is the **process of forming new [[dendritic spines]],** which are tiny protrusions from a neuronâ€™s dendrite that receive input from a single axon of another neuron.

## Key Features

- Spinogenesis is critical for brain development and [[synaptic plasticity]].
- The formation of new spines is associated with strengthening synaptic connections and is necessary for certain types of learning and memory.
