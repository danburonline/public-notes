Diffusion tensor tractography/imaging (DTI) is a **neuroimaging technique** that uses **diffusion MRI data to map the white matter tracts in the brain.** It estimates the trajectory and connectivity patterns of neural fibres by **measuring the diffusion of water molecules** along them. This technique provides information about brain regions' structural connectivity and organisation, allowing researchers and clinicians to investigate neural pathways and better understand brain functioning and connectivity.
