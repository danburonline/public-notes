The basal ganglia are a **group of subcortical nuclei located in the brain.** They are involved in various functions, including the control of movement, learning, and emotions. The basal ganglia also play a role in forming memories and regulating motivation and reward-seeking behaviour.

- **Structure:** The basal ganglia consist of four major components: the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra.
- **Function:** The basal ganglia are involved in motor control, learning, and emotion, and they play a role in the formation of memories. They are also involved in the regulation of motivation and reward-seeking behaviour.
- **Disorders:** Dysfunction of the basal ganglia can lead to various disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Tourette’s syndrome.
