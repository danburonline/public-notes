Histogenesis is the **process of the formation and development of different types of tissues from embryonic cells.** This process occurs during embryonic development, guiding cells into differentiating into the various types of tissues that make up an organism’s body.

## Germ Layers

The three primary germ layers give rise to distinct tissue types:

- **Ectoderm** → nervous system, skin, pigment cells
- **Mesoderm** → muscle, blood, kidney
- **Endoderm** → digestive and respiratory linings, glands

Neural tissue derives from the ectoderm, through the processes of [[Neurulation]] and [[Neurogenesis]].

## Stages of Histogenesis

1. **Proliferation**: Cells divide and multiply.
2. **Migration**: Cells move to their appropriate locations. See [[Neuronal migration]].
3. **Differentiation**: Cells take on specific characteristics and functions.
4. **Death** (also known as [[apoptosis]]): Some cells die to shape the final structure of the tissue or organ.
