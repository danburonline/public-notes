Histogenesis is the **process of the formation and development of different types of tissues from embryonic cells.** This process occurs during embryonic development, guiding cells into differentiating into the various types of tissues that make up an organism’s body.

## Stages of Histogenesis

Histogenesis includes several stages:

1. **Proliferation**: In this stage, the cells divide and multiply.
2. **Migration**: The cells move to their appropriate locations.
3. **Differentiation**: The cells take on specific characteristics and functions.
4. **Death** (also known as [[apoptosis]]): Some cells die to shape the final structure of the tissue or organ.
