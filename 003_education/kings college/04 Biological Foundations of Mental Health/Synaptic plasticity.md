[[Pre- and post-synaptic|Synaptic]] plasticity is the **brain’s ability to strengthen or weaken synapses, or connections between neurons,** in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

## Key Features

- **Long-term potentiation (LTP):** This is a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from stimulating them synchronously. It’s one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.
- **Long-term depression (LTD):** This is the long-term decrease in the efficacy of neuronal synapses following a decrease in their activity.

## Temporal Dynamics

- **Early-phase plasticity**: Lasts minutes to hours; involves post-translational modifications and trafficking of existing receptors. Protein synthesis-independent.
- **Late-phase plasticity**: Lasts hours to days; requires new protein synthesis and structural changes at the synapse.

## Molecular Mechanisms

NMDA receptors act as **coincidence detectors**—requiring both presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarisation to open. This implements the [[Hebbian synaptic plasticity|Hebbian principle]]. Changes in synaptic strength involve AMPA receptor insertion (LTP) or removal (LTD) from the postsynaptic membrane.
