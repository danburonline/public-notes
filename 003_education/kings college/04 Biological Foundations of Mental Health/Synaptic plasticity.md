[[Pre- and post-synaptic|Synaptic]] plasticity is the **brain’s ability to strengthen or weaken synapses, or connections between neurons,** in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

## Key Features

- **Long-term potentiation (LTP):** This is a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from stimulating them synchronously. It’s one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.
- **Long-term depression (LTD):** This is the long-term decrease in the efficacy of neuronal synapses following a decrease in their activity.
