[Synaptic](Pre-%20and%20post-synaptic.md) plasticity is the **brain’s ability to strengthen or weaken synapses, or connections between neurons,** in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

## Key Features

- **Long-term potentiation (LTP):** This is a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from stimulating them synchronously. It’s one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.
- **Long-term depression (LTD):** This is the long-term decrease in the efficacy of neuronal synapses following a decrease in their activity.

## Temporal Dynamics

- **Early-phase plasticity**: Lasts minutes to hours; involves post-translational modifications and trafficking of existing receptors. Protein synthesis-independent.
- **Late-phase plasticity**: Lasts hours to days; requires new protein synthesis and structural changes at the synapse.

## Molecular Mechanisms

NMDA receptors act as **coincidence detectors**—requiring both presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarisation to open. This implements the [Hebbian principle](Hebbian%20synaptic%20plasticity.md). Changes in synaptic strength involve AMPA receptor insertion (LTP) or removal (LTD) from the postsynaptic membrane.

## Plasticity Mechanisms Overview

Synaptic plasticity is the hub concept connecting biological learning mechanisms to computational models and clinical applications:

- [Hebbian synaptic plasticity](Hebbian%20synaptic%20plasticity.md): The foundational principle—"cells that fire together, wire together"
- [Local learning rules](../09%20Research%20Ethics%20to%20Reviewing%20and%20Critical%20Analysis/Local%20learning%20rules.md): Computational abstractions of biological plasticity (STDP, BCM, Oja's rule)
- [Synaptic gain](../07%20Neurodevelopmental%20Disorders/Synaptic%20gain.md): Modulation of overall synaptic efficacy
- [Hebbian assemblies](../../../004_subsidiary/_%20general%20knowledge/Hebbian%20assemblies.md): Functional neural groups formed through repeated co-activation

These mechanisms underlie memory formation, skill acquisition, and neural development.
