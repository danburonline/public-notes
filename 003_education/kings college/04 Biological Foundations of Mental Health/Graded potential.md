Graded potentials are **changes in membrane potential that vary in size** (i.e., they are “graded”). They are the direct result of changes in ion flow across the neuron’s membrane.

- They occur in the dendrites and cell bodies of the neuron (the receptive portions of the neuron).
- They can **either be depolarising** (bringing the membrane potential closer to the threshold level) **or hyperpolarising** (taking the membrane potential further from the threshold level).
- The magnitude of a graded potential **decreases over distance due to the leaky nature of neuronal membranes.**
- Unlike action potentials, graded potentials **do not follow the all-or-nothing principle.** The strength of the potential change can increase or decrease based on the strength of the stimulus.
- Graded potentials can summate to reach the threshold of excitation, leading to the generation of an action potential.
