## [[Types of amnesia#Anterograde Amnesia|Anterograde]] Transport

- **Definition:** The process of moving materials from the neuron’s cell body down the axon towards the synaptic terminals.
- **Purpose:** Transports vesicles containing neurotransmitters, proteins, lipids, and other organelles necessary for synaptic transmission (neuron communication).
- **Main Motor Proteins:** Kinesins.
- **Importance:** Essential for the normal functioning of the neuron, including its ability to communicate with other neurons.

## [[Types of amnesia#Retrograde Amnesia|Retrograde]] Transport

- **Definition:** The process of moving materials from the synaptic terminals back to the neuron’s cell body.
- **Purpose:** Transports old or damaged cell components, growth factors, and signals from the environment that tell the cell about its external conditions.
- **Main Motor Proteins:** Dyneins.
- **Importance:** Crucial for the neuron’s maintenance, survival, and informed functioning.

## Commonalities

- Both types of transport are facilitated by a system of microtubules, which act like “tracks” for the motor proteins to move along.
- Dysfunction in these transport mechanisms can contribute to the development of various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).
