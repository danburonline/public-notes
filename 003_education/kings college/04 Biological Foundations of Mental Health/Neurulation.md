Neurulation is the **process during embryonic development in which the neural tube is formed.** The neural tube is the precursor to the [[central nervous system]], including the brain and spinal cord. Neurulation involves the folding and fusing a flat sheet of ectodermal cells, known as the neural plate, into a hollow tube structure. This process is critical for the proper development of the nervous system in vertebrate embryos.
