Leak channels, also known as passive or resting channels, are **protein structures that span the neuron’s membrane and allow ions to move in and out of the cell.**

- They are integral membrane proteins forming [[ion channels]] that are constantly open and allow ions to diffuse down their concentration gradient.
- These selective channels permit only certain types of ions, such as sodium (Na+) or potassium (K+), to pass through.
- Potassium leak channels are much more numerous than sodium leak channels, contributing to the [[resting membrane potential]] of -70 mV (the inside of the neuron is negatively charged relative to the outside).
- Leak channels play a vital role in maintaining the neuron’s [[resting membrane potential]] and in the neuron’s ability to change that potential in response to stimulation.

It’s important to note that even though these channels are “leaky”, they are not uncontrolled. The rate of ion flow is determined by the concentration gradient of the ions and the electrical potential across the membrane.
