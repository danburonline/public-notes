Neurogenesis is the **biological process by which new neurons, or nerve cells, are generated.** This process occurs in many different species, including humans, and is most active during prenatal development. However, certain regions of the adult brain can also produce new neurons throughout life, a phenomenon known as adult neurogenesis.

## Historical Context

Historically, it was believed that the human brain was incapable of neurogenesis after birth. However, research from the late 20th and early 21st centuries has challenged this view. Today, itâ€™s well-accepted that neurogenesis occurs in certain regions of the brain, most notably the hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory.

## Stages of Neurogenesis

1. **Proliferation**: Stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells, proliferate to produce daughter cells.
2. **Migration**: Newly generated neurons travel from their birthplaces to their final destinations.
3. **Differentiation**: Once the neurons reach their destination, they differentiate into specific neuron types and begin to grow dendrites and an axon.
4. **Integration**: The new neurons integrate into the existing neuronal circuitry, establishing synaptic connections with other neurons.

## Influencing Factors

Neurogenesis is influenced by various factors, including:

- Age
- [[Stress]]
- Environment
- Exercise
