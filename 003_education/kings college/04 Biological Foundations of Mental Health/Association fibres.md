Association fibres are **neural pathways in the brain that connect different regions within the same cerebral hemisphere.** They allow for communication and integration of information between adjacent and distant brain regions involved in higher cognitive functions, such as perception, memory, language processing, and decision-making. 

Association fibres can be further categorised into **short association fibres**, which connect nearby regions within the same cortical lobe, and **long association fibres**, which link more distant cortical regions in different lobes.

> [!info] Role in Cortical Reorganisation
> Association fibres are critical substrates for **cortical reorganisation** (neuroplasticity). When brain regions are damaged, association fibres provide the anatomical scaffolding through which neighbouring or distant areas can assume lost functions. Short association fibres enable local remapping within a lobe, whilst long association fibres permit broader compensatory recruitment across lobes. This explains why patients with intact white matter tracts show better functional recovery—the "rewiring" of function depends on pre-existing associative connectivity that can be strengthened through Hebbian plasticity.
