Association fibres are **neural pathways in the brain that connect different regions within the same cerebral hemisphere.** They allow for communication and integration of information between adjacent and distant brain regions involved in higher cognitive functions, such as perception, memory, language processing, and decision-making. 

Association fibres can be further categorised into **short association fibres**, which connect nearby regions within the same cortical lobe, and **long association fibres**, which link more distant cortical regions in different lobes.
