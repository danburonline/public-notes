The Axon Initial Segment (AIS) is a specialised **region in a neuron where action potentials are initiated.**

- The AIS is typically found at the junction of the axon and the cell body (soma).
- It is rich in voltage-gated sodium channels, which are crucial for the initiation of action potentials.
- The specific arrangement of [[ion channels]] and density of sodium channels in the AIS makes it a region with a lower threshold for depolarisation compared to other parts of the neuron.
- It acts as a "decision-making" centre for the neuron, as it integrates the incoming signals from the dendrites and cell body and decides whether or not to generate an action potential based on whether the membrane potential reached the threshold or not.
- The AIS also plays key roles in modulating neuronal excitability and maintaining the polarity of nerve cells, and it's involved in various neuropathological conditions.
