The central nervous system (CNS) is the major control centre of the body, **responsible for processing and coordinating information.** It consists of the **brain and the spinal cord.** The CNS can be divided into three main regions: the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain.

1. **Hindbrain:** The hindbrain is the posterior part of the brain and includes several important structures:
	▪	Medulla oblongata: It controls essential functions like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
	▪	Pons: It serves as a bridge between different parts of the brain, aiding in communication and coordinating certain movements.
	▪	Cerebellum: It plays a crucial role in motor coordination, balance, and posture.

2. **Midbrain:** The midbrain is located between the hindbrain and forebrain. It is a relay centre for auditory and visual information and involves eye movement, motor control, and arousal.

3. **Forebrain:** The forebrain is the brain's largest and most complex part. It consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus:
	▪	Cerebrum: It is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as perception, thinking, memory, and voluntary movement. It is divided into two hemispheres, each comprising four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital).
	▪	Thalamus: It acts as a relay station, receiving sensory information (except smell) and directing it to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex.
	▪	Hypothalamus: It plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating various bodily functions, including temperature, hunger, thirst, and hormone production.
