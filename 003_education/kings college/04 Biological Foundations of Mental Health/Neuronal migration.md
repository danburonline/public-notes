Neuronal migration is the **process by which neurons (or nerve cells) move from their place of origin to their intended destination** in the developing brain or nervous system. It is a crucial step in forming a functional nervous system and occurs during the early stages of embryonic development.

## Neuronal Migration in the Adult Brain

While neuronal migration is most prominent during embryonic development, migration can also occur in the adult brain, particularly after the transplantation of stem cells or neural progenitor cells. These cells may migrate from the injection site towards areas of damage or degeneration, though this process is generally more limited than in the developing brain.

- Migratory capacity depends on cell type, brain environment, and injury signals.
- Successful migration and integration are crucial for therapies aiming to repair neural circuits.
