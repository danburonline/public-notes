- The difference in ion concentration between two areas.
- Drives movement of ions.
- Vital for [[Resting membrane potential]], nerve signalling, and cellular metabolism.

> [!info] More about concentration gradients
> - Concentration gradients are established by selective permeability of cell membranes and active transport mechanisms (e.g., sodium-potassium pump).
> - Ions naturally move from areas of high concentration to low concentrationâ€”this passive process is known as diffusion.
> - The energy stored in concentration gradients can be harnessed for various cellular processes, such as generating electrical signals in neurons.
> - Disturbances in concentration gradients can lead to pathological conditions, such as cellular swelling or impaired neural function.
> - In neuroscience, concentration gradients are crucial for synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, and the function of sensory systems.
