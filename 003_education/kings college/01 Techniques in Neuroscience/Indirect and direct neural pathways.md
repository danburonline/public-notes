- The direct pathway, also known as the “excitatory” pathway, is **involved in the initiation of movement by activating neurons in the striatum** that lead to the activation of neurons in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which in turn inhibit the activity of neurons in the ventral lateral thalamus.
- The indirect pathway, also known as the “inhibitory” pathway, is **involved in the inhibition of movement by activating neurons in the striatum** that lead to the inhibition of neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which in turn inhibit the activity of neurons in the internal segment of the globus pallidus, which in turn leads to the inhibition of neurons in the ventral lateral thalamus. The balance between the two pathways determines whether a movement is initiated or suppressed.
