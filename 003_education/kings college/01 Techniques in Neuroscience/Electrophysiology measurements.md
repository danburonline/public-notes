- **Extracellular recording:** Measures electrical activity near neuron surface.
- **Intracellular recording:** Measures electrical activity inside a neuron. Invasive.
- **Single-channel recording:** Records ionic currents through individual [[Ion channels]]. High resolution.

## Technique Hierarchy

From most to least invasive (and highest to lowest spatial resolution):

| Technique | Spatial Resolution | Temporal Resolution | Invasiveness |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Patch clamp | Single channel | μs | High |
| [[Field potential]] | Local circuit | ms | Medium |
| EEG/MEG | Whole brain | ms | Low |

## Trade-offs

- **Spatial vs temporal**: EEG has excellent temporal resolution (ms) but poor spatial localisation; fMRI has good spatial resolution but slow temporal dynamics.
- **Invasiveness vs detail**: Intracellular recordings provide the most detailed information about membrane potentials but require surgical access.

## Signal Sources

Neural electrical signals arise from [[Types of biological electrical activity]]: action potentials, synaptic potentials, and oscillations. Surface recordings (EEG) primarily detect synchronised postsynaptic potentials in cortical pyramidal neurons, which create [[Dipoles in EEG|dipoles]] detectable at the scalp.
