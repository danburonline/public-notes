The phenotype of a cell describes its **observable characteristics, such as shape, size, behaviour, and function.** These traits arise from the complex interplay between the cell’s genotype—the complete set of its genetic information—and the environment in which it exists. Both intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic signals contribute to the unique properties of each cell type, determining how it appears and operates within tissues.

## Key Features

- **Morphology:** Cell shape, size, and the presence of specialised structures (e.g., dendrites in neurons).
- **Protein Expression:** The types and amounts of proteins produced, including enzymes, receptors, and structural proteins.
- **Behaviour:** Functional responses to stimuli, such as migration, proliferation, or synaptic activity.
- **Metabolic Activity:** Distinct metabolic pathways and rates of energy usage.
- **Cell Cycle Status:** Whether the cell is dividing, differentiating, or quiescent.

## Determinants

- **Genetic factors:** DNA sequence, gene expression patterns, and epigenetic modifications.
- **Environmental factors:** Signals from neighbouring cells, extracellular matrix, nutrients, physical forces, and chemical signals (e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters).

## Examples in Neuroscience

- **Neuronal Phenotypes:** Differences in neurotransmitter type (e.g., glutamatergic or GABAergic), electrophysiological properties, and synaptic connections.
- **Glial Cell Phenotypes:** Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia each display unique marker proteins and functions.

## Techniques for Studying Cell Phenotype

- **Microscopy:** Visualises cell shape and structural features.
- **Immunohistochemistry:** Detects specific proteins using labelled antibodies.
- **Transcriptomics:** Analyses gene expression profiles to infer cell function.
- **Flow Cytometry:** Measures physical and chemical characteristics of large numbers of cells quickly.
