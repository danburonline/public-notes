The histology process involves **studying the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues, typically obtained from biopsies or post-mortem specimens.** One crucial step in the process is the sectioning of the tissue, which involves cutting thin slices from the tissue sample. This is done using a microtome, a machine that cuts sections of uniform thickness. The sections are then placed onto glass slides specially treated to prevent the tissue from sticking to the surface.

Once the sections are on the slides, they are usually stained using various dyes or stains to enhance the visibility of specific components under a microscope. Some of the commonly used stains include Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Massonâ€™s Trichrome, and PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff). The choice of stain depends on the type of tissue being studied and the specific components of interest.

In addition to staining, some tissue samples may be processed in wax, either paraffin or plastic, to preserve them for further study. This is known as embedding, and the wax is used to create a solid block of tissue that can be sectioned into thin slices for microscopic examination. Various embedding machines, such as embedding stations, are available for this purpose.

Cryopreservation is another method of preserving tissue for later study. This involves freezing the tissue sample in liquid nitrogen, which prevents the cells from breaking down and helps to preserve their structure and integrity. Cryopreservation is particularly useful for specific tissue types, such as nerve and muscle tissues, that are sensitive to degradation.
