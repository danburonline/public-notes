The initial dip in the BOLD signal is **a decrease observed in the first few seconds after the onset of a stimulus or task in fMRI scans.** The exact cause of the initial dip is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the brainâ€™s hemodynamic response to neural activity. The phenomenon is not reported in all studies, and the amplitude, duration and timing of the initial dip vary across studies depending on the paradigm and subject population being studied.
