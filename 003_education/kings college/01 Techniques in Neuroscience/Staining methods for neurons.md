- **In situ hybridisation:** This type of staining helps us see specific genes in a tissue sample using special probes.
- **Fluorescence microscopy:** This type of staining helps us see cells or tissues tagged with special dyes that light up under a special microscope.
- **Electron microscopy:** This type of imaging uses a special microscope to see tiny details in cells and tissues.
