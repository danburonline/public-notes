The resting membrane potential refers to the **voltage difference across a neuron's membrane when it is inactive and not transmitting a signal.** The neuron's interior is typically around 70 millivolts lower in voltage than the exterior, resulting in a resting membrane potential of -70 millivolts.

## Ion Concentration Gradients

The resting potential arises from unequal distribution of ions across the membrane (see [[Concentration gradients]]):
- **K+**: High inside (~140 mM), low outside (~5 mM)
- **Na+**: Low inside (~15 mM), high outside (~145 mM)
- **Cl-**: Low inside (~10 mM), high outside (~110 mM)

## Na+/K+-ATPase Pump

This active transport protein maintains ionic gradients by pumping **3 Na+ out** and **2 K+ in** per ATP hydrolysed, creating a net negative charge inside the cell.

## Leak Channels

[[Leak channels]] allow passive ion flow down concentration gradients. At rest, the membrane is ~40× more permeable to K+ than Na+ via [[Ion channels]], so K+ efflux dominates, making the interior negative. Changes from resting state lead to [[Hyperpolarisation and depolarisation]].
