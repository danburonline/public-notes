**Homology = similarity due to shared ancestry (contrast with analogy: convergent similarity).** In neuroscience, homology connects regions, circuits, or cell types across species despite divergent form or function.

> “The relative position or connection in homologous parts; they may differ to almost any extent in form and size and yet remain connected together in the same invariable order.” — Darwin

**Why it matters**
- Supports translation from model organisms to humans.
- Anchors consistent nomenclature across taxa.
- Distinguishes shared origin from convergent solutions.

**How to infer homology (integrate multiple lines)**
- Relative position/topology along the neuraxis (e.g., prosomeric order).
- Developmental origin: progenitor zone, patterning signals.
- Gene/regulatory logic: conserved TFs/modules; cross-species single-cell matches.
- Connectivity archetypes: comparable input–output motifs.
- Phylogenetic spread consistent with common ancestry.

> [!example] [[Basal ganglia]] across vertebrates  
> Striatum–pallidum–STN–dopamine motifs are conserved from fish to mammals; shared ventral telencephalic origins and action-selection roles support homology.

> [!example] Pallium subdivisions → mammalian cortex  
> Medial pallium → hippocampus; lateral → piriform; dorsal → [[neocortex]]. Avian/reptilian pallia are homologous despite different lamination.

**Tools you’ll use**
- Fate mapping and patterning markers (e.g., Emx/Pax/Otx; SHH/WNT/FGF).
- Cross-species single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
- Tract tracing and diffusion MRI to compare connectivity motifs.
- Phylogenetic mapping of presence/absence across clades.

> [!warning] Pitfalls  
> Functional similarity alone is weak evidence. Beware name mismatches (e.g., rodent “M2” vs primate premotor) and convergent analogies.

**Quick checklist**
- Define the candidate structure/cell type precisely.
- Gather positional, developmental, and transcriptomic evidence.
- Compare connectivity at the right scale (motifs, not 1:1 tracts).
- State uncertainties and alternative (analogy) hypotheses.
