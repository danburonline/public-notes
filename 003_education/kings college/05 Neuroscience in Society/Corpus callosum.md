![[corpus-callosum.png]]

The corpus callosum is a large, C-shaped **nerve fibre bundle found beneath the cerebral cortex.** It spans the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, and **facilitates interhemispheric communication.**

## Structure

- **Rostrum**: The curved front end.
- **Genu**: The bend of the “C” shape.
- **Body (Trunk)**: The long central portion.
- **Splenium**: The thick rear end.

## Function

- The corpus callosum enables the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate and coordinate with each other.
- It transfers motor, sensory, and cognitive information between the brain hemispheres.

## [[Peripheral nervous system#Diseases and Disorders|Disorders]] And Syndromes

- **Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (ACC)**: A birth defect where the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent.
- **Split-brain Syndrome**: This can occur when the corpus callosum is surgically cut to reduce epileptic seizures.

> [!tip] Interesting facts
> - The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the human brain.
