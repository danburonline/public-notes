**Olfaction, or the sense of smell,** is a complex process that involves two different pathways: orthonasal and retronasal.

## Orthonasal Olfaction

Orthonasal olfaction is the process we commonly associate with smelling. It involves inhaling or drawing in air through the nose.

- This process allows us to detect scents and odours in the environment around us.
- When we breathe in, volatile molecules in the air enter the nose and reach the olfactory receptors, providing the sensation of smell.

## Retronasal Olfaction

On the other hand, retronasal olfaction is a process that happens internally during eating or drinking.

- When we chew or swallow food, volatile molecules are released and travel through the back of our throat to the nasal cavity.
- This process allows us to perceive flavours aromatically, adding depth and complexity to the tastes experienced by our taste buds.
