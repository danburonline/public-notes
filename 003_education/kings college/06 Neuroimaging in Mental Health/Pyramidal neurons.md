Pyramidal neurons are a **type of excitatory neuron found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and the amygdala.** They are named for their **distinct pyramid-shaped cell bodies** with a large apical dendrite, multiple basal dendrites, and a long axon that can extend to other parts of the brain.

## Characteristics of Pyramidal Neurons

- **Morphology**: These neurons have a pyramid-shaped soma, with a single apical dendrite that extends towards the cortical surface and multiple basal dendrites radiating outwards.
- **Function**: As the principal projection neurons, they transmit excitatory signals using the neurotransmitter glutamate. They play a key role in a wide range of cognitive processes, including learning, memory, and executive functions.
- **Connectivity**: They form connections with other neurons both locally and across distant brain regions, facilitating complex neural networks.
- **Diversity**: Pyramidal neurons vary in size, structure, and function depending on their cortical layer and location, reflecting the diversity of tasks they perform.

## Role in Neural Circuits

- **Cortical Columns**: Pyramidal neurons are organised into vertical structures called cortical columns, considered the basic functional units of the cerebral cortex.
- **Synaptic Integration**: They integrate synaptic inputs from thousands of other neurons, summing excitatory and inhibitory signals to determine their output.
- **Plasticity**: Exhibiting [synaptic plasticity](../04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Synaptic%20plasticity.md), pyramidal neurons can strengthen or weaken their connections based on experience, which is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory.

## Clinical Significance

- **Neurological Disorders**: Abnormalities in pyramidal neurons have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.
- **Target for Therapeutics**: Due to their crucial role in brain function, pyramidal neurons are often targets for therapeutic interventions to treat neurological conditions.
