The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is a highly selective **semipermeable border that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).** The BBB is crucial in maintaining the brain’s microenvironment and protecting it from potentially harmful substances.

## Structure

- **Endothelial Cells:** The BBB comprises tightly connected endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvessels. These cells restrict the passage of substances through tight junctions, complex structures composed of various proteins.
- **Basement [[Resting membrane potential|Membrane]]:** This thin, dense layer of extracellular matrix provides structural support for the endothelial cells and separates them from pericytes and astrocytic end feet.
- **Pericytes and Astrocytes:** Pericytes embedded in the basement membrane regulate blood flow and endothelial cell function. Astrocyte endfeet covers most of the capillary surface and is involved in signalling and nutrient transport.

## Functions

- **Selective Permeability:** The BBB allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as selective transport of molecules like glucose and amino acids crucial to neural function.
- **Protection:** It protects the brain from “foreign substances” in the blood that may injure the brain, including neurotransmitters and hormones systematically regulated elsewhere in the body.
- **Homeostasis:** The BBB maintains a constant environment for the brain, which is critical for its proper functioning, including ionic balance and transport of nutrients.

## Clinical Significance

- **Drug Delivery:** One of the biggest challenges in treating brain diseases is overcoming the BBB to deliver drugs effectively.
- **Pathology:** Several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, involve dysfunction of the BBB.
