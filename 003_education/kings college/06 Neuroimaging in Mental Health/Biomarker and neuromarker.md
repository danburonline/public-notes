## Biomarkers

### Definition

- **Biomarkers** are biological measures used to assess the state of an organism’s health or disease. These can be molecules, genes, characteristics, or specific alterations in the body.

### Types

- **Molecular Biomarkers:** DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, or metabolites.
- **Clinical Biomarkers:** Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or body mass index (BMI).

### Uses

- **Disease Diagnosis:** Identifying specific biomarkers for early detection of diseases like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease.
- **Treatment Monitoring:** Evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment regimen.
- **Risk Assessment:** Determining the likelihood of developing a disease.

### Examples

- **Glucose levels** in diabetes.
- **Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)** for prostate cancer detection.

## Neuromarkers

### Definition

- **Neuromarkers** are a subset of biomarkers that are specifically related to the functioning of the nervous system.

### Types

- **Brain Activity Indicators:** EEG, fMRI signals.
- **Neurochemical Indicators:** Levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.

### Uses

- **Neurological [[Peripheral nervous system#Diseases and Disorders|Disorders]]:** Diagnosing and monitoring conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or epilepsy.
- **Brain Function Assessment:** Understanding cognitive functions, stress responses, and emotional states.
- **Therapeutic Interventions:** Evaluating the impact of treatments on brain function.

### Examples

- **Beta-Amyloid plaques** in Alzheimer’s disease.
- **Dopamine levels** in Parkinson’s disease.

## Differences Between Biomarkers and Neuromarkers

- **Scope:** Biomarkers cover a broad range of biological markers, while neuromarkers are specifically related to the nervous system.
- **Applications:** Neuromarkers are primarily used for neurological conditions and brain function assessment, whereas biomarkers are widely applied in general health and disease.
- **Techniques:** Neuromarker assessment often involves neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques like EEG or fMRI, unlike some general biomarkers.
