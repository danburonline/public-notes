Understanding the cardinal features of a symptom is crucial in **medical diagnosis and treatment.** Here are the seven key aspects to consider:

1. **[[Spatial and temporal summation#Temporal Summation|Temporal]] Characteristics**
   - *Key Questions*: When did it start? What has happened over time? Is it constant or intermittent?
   - *Importance*: Helps determine the symptom’s onset, duration, and pattern.
2. **Location**
   - *Description*: Define the area or areas affected. There may be different pains in more than one location.
   - *Significance*: Localising the symptoms can aid in identifying the affected organ or system.
3. **Intensity**
   - *Documentation*: Record the patient’s report using the visual analogue and verbal scales.
   - *Note*: It’s crucial to document the patient’s own experience, not the clinician’s impression of the pain.
4. **Quality**
   - *Types*: Somatic, visceral, neuropathic.
   - *Relevance*: The quality of the symptom guides the treatment approach.
5. **Aggravating/Alleviating Factors**
   - *Examples*: Movement, position, breathing, mood, eating, etc.
   - *Purpose*: Understanding what exacerbates or relieves the symptom can inform management strategies.
6. **Related Symptoms**
   - *Association*: Identify any symptoms that occur alongside the primary symptom.
   - *Clinical Implication*: Related symptoms can provide clues about underlying conditions.
7. **Associated Symptoms**
   - *Identification*: Look for other symptoms related to the main complaint.
   - *Diagnostic Value*: These can offer additional insights into the patient’s condition.
