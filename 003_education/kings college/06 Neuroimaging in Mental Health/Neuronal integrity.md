[[Neuronal cell types|Neuronal]] integrity refers to the **health and functional condition of neurons**. Maintaining neuronal integrity is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Here are key aspects of neuronal integrity:

1. **Structure and Connectivity**: Neurons should maintain their structure, including the cell body, axons, and dendrites. Healthy connectivity with other neurons, often through synapses, is essential for efficient communication within the nervous system.
2. **Biochemical Balance**: Neurons rely on a delicate balance of neurotransmitters, ions, and other biochemicals. Disruptions in this balance can affect neuron function and communication.
3. **[[Types of biological electrical activity|Electrical]] Activity**: Neurons communicate through electrical signals. Maintaining the proper electrical activity and the ability to generate action potentials is critical for neuron function.
4. **Metabolic Health**: Neurons need energy to function, which they get from glucose and oxygen. Metabolic disruptions can impair neuron health.
5. **Repair and Regeneration**: While neurons have limited ability to regenerate, maintaining some level of repair capacity is important, especially in response to injury or disease.
6. **Resistance to Damage**: This includes the ability to withstand or recover from insults such as inflammation, oxidative stress, or physical damage.
