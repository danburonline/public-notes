## Region(s) Of Interest (ROI) Analysis

### Definition

- **ROI Analysis** refers to a technique in neuroimaging where specific, predefined areas of the brain are studied. These regions are selected based on prior research or hypothesis.

### Key Points

- **Selection of Regions**: The regions are often chosen because of their known or suspected involvement in a particular cognitive or behavioural function.
- **Advantages**: More sensitive to localised brain activity, can provide detailed information about specific brain regions.
- **Limitations**: Can miss important findings outside the predefined regions, and the selection of regions may introduce bias.

## Whole Brain Analysis

### Definition

- **Whole Brain Analysis** is a neuroimaging approach that examines the entire brain simultaneously rather than focusing on specific regions.

### Key Points

- **Holistic View**: This method offers a comprehensive view of brain activity, without the need for prior hypotheses about specific regions.
- **Data-Driven**: Often involves exploratory or data-driven techniques to identify areas of interest.
- **Advantages**: Can reveal unexpected areas of activity, useful for exploratory studies.
- **Limitations**: Requires more computational power and can be less sensitive to small localised changes.
