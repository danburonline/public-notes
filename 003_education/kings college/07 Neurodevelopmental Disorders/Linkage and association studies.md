Linkage and association studies are **two fundamental genetic approaches used in neuroscience to understand the genetic underpinnings of brain-related traits and disorders.** These methods provide insights into how genetic variations contribute to the structure, function, and pathology of the nervous system.

## [[Forward and backward genetics|Genetics]] and Environment in Neurobehavioral Studies

Linkage and association studies are central in examining the role of genetics and environmental factors on behaviour. These studies help uncover the influence of genes and their interaction with environmental variables on neurological and psychiatric conditions.

### Linkage Studies

- Focus on familial patterns, particularly in conditions like schizophrenia.
- Compare chromosomal regions between affected and unaffected family members.

### Association Studies

- Correlate genetic variants (e.g., through GWAS) with behavioural traits.
- Explore how individual DNA sequences contribute to psychiatric disorders.

### Integrating Environment

- Both study types consider gene-environment interactions to understand the complexity of behaviour.
- Environmental factors (like stress, upbringing, toxin exposure) interact with genetic predispositions to influence outcomes.
