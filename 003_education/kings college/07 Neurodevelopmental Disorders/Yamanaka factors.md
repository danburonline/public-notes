Yamanaka factors are a set of **four transcription factors that have the ability to reprogram differentiated adult cells into pluripotent stem cells.** This groundbreaking discovery was made by Shinya Yamanaka and his team, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in [[Electrophysiology measurements|Physiology]] or [[Personalised regenerative medicine|Medicine]] in 2012. These factors are critical for inducing pluripotency, which is the ability of a cell to develop into any cell in the body.

## The Four Factors

- **Oct3/4 (POU5F1)**: A transcription factor pivotal for the self-renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
- **Sox2**: Another transcription factor that works closely with Oct3/4. It is also essential for maintaining self-renewal.
- **Klf4**: Contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency but can also be involved in regulating cell differentiation.
- **c-Myc**: Known to regulate cell growth and [[apoptosis]], it plays a role in cellular reprogramming and the proliferation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

> [!info] Brief history of the Yamanaka factors
> - 2006: Kazutoshi Takahashi and Shinya Yamanaka screen 24 embryonic stem cell–enriched genes in mouse fibroblasts using an Fbx15-βgeo selection system; iterative subtraction narrows the set to Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, yielding iPSC-like colonies.
> - 2007: Fully pluripotent mouse iPSCs confirmed with stricter Nanog/Oct4 selection; human iPSCs generated; alternative cocktails (e.g., Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Lin28) show the principle is modular; c‑Myc boosts efficiency but is dispensable.
> - 2008–2011: Safer, non-integrating delivery emerges (Sendai virus, episomes, mRNA/protein, small molecules), reducing insertional mutagenesis and tumour risk; robust differentiation and disease modelling expand.
> - 2012: Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for cellular reprogramming.
> - Since: Clinical-grade iPSC banks, autologous cell therapy pilots, and work on partial reprogramming and epigenetic rejuvenation continue to refine the field.
