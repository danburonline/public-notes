Weber's law, also known as Weber-Fechner law, is a principle in psychology that states that **the perceived difference between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli and is constant over the range of the stimuli.** In other words, the just noticeable difference (JND) between two stimuli is a constant fraction of the intensity of the stimuli.

Weber's law has a logarithmic relationship because it states that the ratio of the difference threshold (JND) to the initial stimulus intensity is a constant known as the Weber fraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as `ΔI/I = k`, where `ΔI` is the difference threshold, `I` is the initial stimulus intensity, and `k` is the Weber fraction. Taking the logarithm of both sides of this equation gives `log(ΔI) - log(I) = log(k)`, which shows that the difference threshold is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. This logarithmic relationship is why Weber's law is often associated with the field of psychophysics, which studies the relationship between physical stimuli and their psychological effects.
