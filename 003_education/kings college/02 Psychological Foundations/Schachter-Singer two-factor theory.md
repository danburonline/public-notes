The Schachter-Singer Theory, also known as the Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, is a modification of the [[James-Lange theory of emotion|James-Lange]] theory. This theory proposes that our emotions are determined by two factors: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation.

## Theory Explanation

1. **Event**: A significant event occurs.
2. **Physiological Response**: This event causes a physiological response.
3. **Cognitive Interpretation**: At the same time, we try to understand the reason for this physiological arousal. We look for environmental cues to help make a cognitive interpretation.
4. **Emotion**: The combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation results in the experience of emotion.

According to this theory, physiological arousal is similar across different emotions, and our interpretation of the reason for this arousal leads to the experience of a particular emotion. For example, the physiological arousal experienced in both fear and excitement is similar, but the cognitive interpretation of the situation determines whether the emotion is fear or excitement.
