Salient events refer to occurrences that stand out from the norm due to their distinctiveness, novelty, or emotional intensity.

## Key Features

1. **Distinctiveness:** Salient events are noticeable and memorable because they differ significantly from routine or expected events.
2. **Emotional Intensity:** Events with strong emotional content, such as fear, joy, or surprise, often become salient.

**Impact on Cognition:**
1. **[[Endogenous and exogenous attention|Attention]]:** Salient events capture attention more readily than non-salient events due to their novelty or emotional intensity.

2. **Memory:** They are more likely to be remembered because the brain prioritises salient information.

**Use in Research:**
In cognitive and neurological research, salient events are used to study attention, memory, and emotion processing. For instance, researchers might use emotionally charged images or unexpected occurrences to see how these affect participantsâ€™ attention and memory.

**Real-World Application:**
Understanding the cognitive impact of salient events can help in various fields, such as education (designing memorable learning experiences), advertising (creating standout ads), and psychology (understanding trauma and its effects).
