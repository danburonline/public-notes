**Behaviourism** is a psychological approach that studies observable [[Behaviour|behaviour]] rather than internal mental states.

- **Stimulus/Antecedent:** what comes before the [[Behaviour|behaviour]]
- **Black Box/Intervening Variables:** internal processes between stimulus and behaviour
- **Response/Behaviour:** observable behaviour that follows the stimulus
- **Manipulating antecedents and consequences:** can shape and control behaviour
