**Behaviourism** is a psychological approach that studies observable behaviour rather than internal mental states.

## The S-R Model

The Stimulus-Response (S-R) model, as illustrated in the diagram above, conceptualises psychological processes as a linear chain of events. It posits that environmental inputs lead to observable outputs, while the internal mechanisms remain largely inaccessible to scientific inquiry. This framework is often described as "black box" psychology, where the focus is strictly on the relationship between the antecedent and the resulting action.

- **Stimulus/Antecedent**: The environmental trigger or event that precedes the behaviour (Input). This can be a simple sensory input or a complex situational context that sets the stage for a response.
- **Black Box/Intervening Variables**: The internal processes occurring between stimulus and response. In early methodological behaviourism, these were ignored or treated as scientifically irrelevant. Later neobehaviourists introduced intervening variables to explain how internal states might mediate the S-R relationship.
- **Response/Behaviour**: The observable and measurable action that follows the stimulus (Output). This is the primary unit of analysis for behaviourists, as it can be objectively recorded and quantified.
- **Consequences**: The outcomes following a response that determine the likelihood of the behaviour recurring. By manipulating these consequences, researchers can shape and control behaviour through reinforcement or punishment.

## Historical Development

- **John B. Watson**: Often cited as the father of behaviourism, Watson established methodological behaviourism in the early 20th century. He argued that psychology must restrict itself to observable phenomena to be a truly objective science, explicitly rejecting the subjective methods of [Legacy functional introspection](Legacy%20functional%20introspection.md) and [Legacy structuralism](Legacy%20structuralism.md).
- **Ivan Pavlov**: A Russian physiologist who discovered [Classical conditioning](Classical%20conditioning.md) through his work on the digestive systems of dogs. He demonstrated how neutral stimuli can elicit reflexive responses through repeated association with unconditioned stimuli, providing a biological basis for learning.
- **B.F. Skinner**: Developed radical behaviourism and the theory of [Operant learning](Operant%20learning.md). Skinner focused on how voluntary behaviour is shaped by its consequences, utilising controlled environments such as [The operant chamber (Skinner box)](The%20operant%20chamber%20%28Skinner%20box%29.md) to study reinforcement and punishment.
- **Edward C. Tolman**: Introduced purposive behaviourism, suggesting that behaviour is goal-directed rather than just a series of reflexive responses. His work on [Latent learning](Latent%20learning.md) and cognitive maps in rats laid the groundwork for neobehaviourism and the eventual cognitive shift.

## Types of Behaviourism

- **Methodological Behaviourism**: A normative theory about the scientific conduct of psychology. It asserts that only observable behaviours should be studied, but does not necessarily deny the existence of mental states, only their utility as scientific data.
- **Radical Behaviourism**: A more expansive philosophy that asserts private events—such as thoughts, feelings, and perceptions—are also behaviours subject to the same environmental laws as public behaviours. This perspective forms the basis of [Legacy radical behaviourism](Legacy%20radical%20behaviourism.md).
- **Neobehaviourism**: An evolution of the field that incorporates intervening variables and internal states to explain the complex relationship between stimulus and response. It often adheres to [Morgan's cannon](Morgan%27s%20cannon.md) to ensure that higher psychological processes are not invoked when simpler explanations suffice.

## Core Mechanisms

Behavioural change and maintenance are driven by several fundamental processes. [Reinforcement and reinforcers](Reinforcement%20and%20reinforcers.md) increase the probability of a response, while the specific timing and frequency of these rewards are governed by [Reinforcement schedules](Reinforcement%20schedules.md). Conversely, [Extinction learning](Extinction%20learning.md) occurs when a previously reinforced behaviour is no longer rewarded, leading to its gradual cessation. 

Organisms also exhibit a [Generalisation gradient](Generalisation%20gradient.md), where responses are elicited by stimuli that are physically similar to the original conditioned stimulus. Furthermore, [Vicarious learning](Vicarious%20learning.md) allows for the acquisition of new behaviours through the observation of others, bypassing the need for direct experience and highlighting the social dimensions of behavioural change.

## Legacy and Critique

Behaviourism dominated the psychological landscape for much of the early 20th century, providing rigorous experimental methods and highly effective therapeutic techniques such as applied behaviour analysis. However, the cognitive revolution of the 1950s and 60s led to a significant shift towards [Cognitive psychology vs cognitive neuroscience](Cognitive%20psychology%20vs%20cognitive%20neuroscience.md). 

Critics argued that the "black box" must be opened to understand complex human cognition, language acquisition, and decision-making. While behaviourism is praised for its scientific rigour and practical applications, it is often criticised for failing to account for innate biological structures, evolutionary predispositions, and the richness of subjective experience.

## Connection to Consciousness Studies

Within the framework of consciousness engineering, behaviourism presents a significant challenge to [Phenomenology](../03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Phenomenology.md) by prioritising external observation over first-person experience. It raises profound questions regarding [Philosophical zombies](../../../001_private/_%20general%20knowledge/Philosophical%20zombies.md)—hypothetical entities that behave exactly like conscious humans but possess no inner experience. 

In modern terms, behaviourist principles are often mapped to the distinction between [Access and phenomenal consciousness](../../../001_private/videos/Access%20and%20phenomenal%20consciousness.md), where observable "access" functions are studied while the "phenomenal" quality remains elusive. Understanding these behavioural constraints is essential for bridging the gap between objective neural function and the subjective nature of [Purposive behaviour](Purposive%20behaviour.md), providing a foundation for quantitative models of agency.
