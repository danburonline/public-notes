In psychology, a neutral stimulus is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit any specific response or reaction from an individual. It is a stimulus with no inherent significance or meaning to the person.

A classic example of a neutral stimulus is the sound of a bell before it is associated with food in [[Classical conditioning]]. The sound of the bell is initially neutral because it does not naturally cause a response in the dog.
