## 1. Attitudes: Evaluate Negative and Positive, Decision Making. Difference Between Values and Attitudes

- **Attitudes** are the evaluations or judgments we make about objects, ideas, events, or people. They can be positive, negative, or neutral and are developed through various forms of learning.
  - *Positive attitudes*: Positive evaluations that lead to favouring or liking an object, person, or event. These often lead to supportive or constructive behaviours.
  - *Negative attitudes*: Negative evaluations that lead to disfavouring or disliking an object, person, or event. These often result in destructive or avoidant behaviours.
- Decision-making is influenced by attitudes. People are more likely to choose actions that align with their positive attitudes and avoid those that conflict with their negative attitudes. However, complex decision-making may involve a trade-off between positive and negative attitudes.
- **Values** are deeply held beliefs about what is important or desirable. They are guiding principles that influence behaviour and attitudes, shaping our perception of the world.
- **Difference between Values and Attitudes**: Values are generally stable and enduring, forming the basis of our ethical framework. Conversely, attitudes can be more flexible, subject to change with new information or experiences. While values represent our belief system, attitudes are our predisposed reactions to specific objects, people, or events based on that belief system.

## 2. Attitudes: Utilitarian and Symbolic Functions

- **Utilitarian function** relates to the practical benefits or drawbacks of holding a certain attitude. People adopt attitudes that lead to rewards or avoid punishments. For example, a person may have a positive attitude toward recycling because it contributes to environmental preservation (a reward).
- **Symbolic function**: This refers to the expression of one’s identity and self-concept. Attitudes reflect our values, beliefs, and social identity. For instance, a person may hold a positive attitude toward a political party that aligns with their values and beliefs.

## 3. Where Attitudes Come From: Mere Exposure, [[Vicarious learning|Learning]], Culture, and Stereotypes

- **Mere Exposure**: The mere exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon where people develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. The more we’re exposed to something, the more likely we are to develop a positive attitude towards it.
- **Learning**: Attitudes are learned through direct experiences and social learning. This includes [[classical conditioning]], operant conditioning, and observational learning. For instance, if we receive positive reinforcement after performing an action, we are likely to develop a positive attitude towards it.
- **Culture**: Our cultural background and societal norms greatly shape our attitudes. Culture prescribes what is acceptable and what is not, influencing our attitudes toward various social issues, behaviours, and people.
- **Stereotypes**: Stereotypes are generalised beliefs about a certain group of people. They influence our attitudes by providing simplified and generalised assumptions that can lead to bias and prejudice. It’s important to note that stereotypes often lack nuance and accuracy, leading to unjustified negative or positive attitudes.
