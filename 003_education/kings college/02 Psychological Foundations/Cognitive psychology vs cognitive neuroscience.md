Cognitive psychology studies mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and language, while cognitive neuroscience studies the biological and neural mechanisms that underlie these processes. Cognitive psychology focuses on behaviour and cognition, while cognitive neuroscience focuses on the brain and neural activity.

## Methodological Differences

- **Cognitive psychology**: Primarily uses behavioural experiments—reaction times, accuracy, verbal reports. Infers internal processes from observable behaviour.
- **Cognitive neuroscience**: Combines behavioural methods with neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG, MEG) and lesion studies to link cognitive functions to brain regions. See [Comparison of neuroimaging methods](../01%20Techniques%20in%20Neuroscience/Comparison%20of%20neuroimaging%20methods.md).

## Historical Development

Cognitive psychology emerged in the 1950s-60s as a reaction against [Behaviourism](Behaviourism.md), which rejected the study of internal mental states. Early approaches like [Legacy functional introspection](Legacy%20functional%20introspection.md) attempted to study consciousness directly but lacked rigour. The cognitive revolution reinstated mental processes as legitimate scientific objects, while cognitive neuroscience (1980s onwards) added biological grounding.

## Integration

Modern research increasingly integrates both approaches: cognitive psychology provides theoretical frameworks and behavioural paradigms, while cognitive neuroscience tests these models against neural data.
