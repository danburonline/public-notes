The availability heuristic refers to the **tendency individuals have to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily they can recall instances of it from memory.** When people can quickly bring examples to mind, they are more likely to believe such events are common or probable.

> [!warning] Decision-Making Errors
> Relying on the availability heuristic can lead to errors in judgement. People may overestimate the probability of rare events simply because those events are more memorable or salient, such as dramatic news stories or personal experiences.

This cognitive shortcut is influenced by various factors, including media coverage, personal encounters, and prevailing cultural norms. The frequency and vividness with which certain events are portrayed, especially in the media, can distort one's perception of their actual likelihood.

> To counteract the influence of the availability heuristic, it's beneficial to seek information from a range of sources and consider statistical base rates rather than relying solely on anecdotal evidence or memorable examples.
