Psycholinguistics is the **scientific study of the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension, production, and acquisition**, ergo the study of the interrelation between linguistic factors and psychological aspects. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws upon theories and methods from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to investigate how humans learn, use, and process language.
