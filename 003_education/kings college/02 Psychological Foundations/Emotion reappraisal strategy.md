Reappraisal is a cognitive emotion regulation strategy that involves **changing how we think about a situation to alter our emotional response.** This can involve reframing the situation in a more positive light, focusing on the potential benefits of the situation, or finding a different perspective. Reappraisal can help us to manage difficult emotions, reduce [[stress]], and increase our overall well-being.
