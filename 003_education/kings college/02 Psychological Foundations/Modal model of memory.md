The Modal Model of Memory is a model that explains how information is processed, stored and retrieved from memory. It was **developed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968** and is still used today as a way to explain how memories are formed and how they can be retrieved.

**The model consists of three stages: sensory memory, short-term memory, and [[long-term memory]].** Sensory memory is the brief storage of information from our senses, such as what we see, hear, smell, and taste. Short-term memory is the active storage of information for a short period of time. Finally, [[long-term memory]] is the permanent storage of information. This model helps to explain how we remember and retrieve information from our memories.
