The James-Lange Theory of Emotion is a significant theory within the field of psychology that suggests **our emotional experience is a reaction to our bodily responses to an event.**

## Theory Explanation

1. **Event**: A significant event occurs.
2. **Physiological Response**: This event causes a physiological response, such as elevated heart rate, sweating, or increased adrenaline.
3. **Interpretation**: We then interpret this physiological response as an emotion. For instance, an increased heart rate might be interpreted as fear.

In summary, this theory posits that we do not tremble because we are scared but because we tremble.
