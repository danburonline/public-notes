Overgeneral autobiographical memory is a phenomenon where **individuals have difficulty recalling specific events from their personal past and instead provide generalised summaries of events.**

## Key Features

1. **Memory Detail:** Individuals with OGM tend to remember events in a categorical or generalised way (e.g., “I always have fun at parties”) rather than recalling specific instances (e.g., “I had fun at John’s birthday party last Saturday”).
2. **Difficulty with Specifics:** They might struggle to recall specific times, places, sensations, and people associated with past events.

**Relation to Mental [[Mental health terminologies|Health]]:**
OGM is often observed in individuals with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and it’s believed to serve as a cognitive avoidance strategy that prevents the recall of distressing details. It’s also associated with a greater risk of depression and poorer treatment outcomes.

**Use in Research:**
OGM is a focus of research in clinical psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Studies often use the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), which assesses the ability to recall specific events in response to cue words.

**Real-World Application:**
Understanding OGM can assist in diagnosing and treating various mental health disorders. In therapy, techniques like Memory Specificity Training (MeST) aim to increase the recall of specific positive memories to combat OGM.
