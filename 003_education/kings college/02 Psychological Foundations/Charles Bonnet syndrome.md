Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition that **causes people with visual impairments to experience vivid, complex visual hallucinations that are not related to any real external stimuli.** It is believed to be caused by the brain’s attempt to interpret the lack of visual input. It is most commonly seen in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or other eye conditions that cause vision loss.

> [!info] Charles Bonnet syndrome: where do hallucinations come from? (brief)
> - Sensory deafferentation/release: vision loss disinhibits visual cortex (phantom-vision analogue).
> - Predictive coding: low sensory precision lets strong priors fill in; episodes likelier in dim light or inactivity.
> - Network specificity and hyperexcitability: occipital/ventral stream spikes; content maps to face/object/scene areas.
> - Typical profile: older adults with AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy; triggers include low light, fatigue; eased by brighter light or active viewing.
> - Not psychosis and course: insight preserved, purely visual; often wanes over months to 1–2 years, though can persist.
