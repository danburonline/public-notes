Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition that causes people with visual impairments to experience vivid, complex visual hallucinations that are not related to any real external stimuli. It is believed to be caused by the brainâ€™s attempt to interpret the lack of visual input. It is most commonly seen in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or other eye conditions that cause vision loss.
