Structuralism is a school of thought in psychology that emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is focused on **studying the basic elements or structures of consciousness and how they relate to each other.** Structuralism was an early attempt to understand the human mind through introspection, which involved examining oneâ€™s own thoughts and experiences systematically.

> - **Structuralism** analyses consciousness by breaking it down into its basic elements and examining how these relate, using introspection as its main method.  
> - **[[Phenomenology]]**, in contrast, focuses on describing lived experience as it is perceived, without reducing it to parts or relying on introspection. It aims to capture the essence and meaning of experience from the first-person perspective.
