Structuralism is a school of thought in psychology that emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is focused on studying the basic elements or structures of consciousness and how they relate to each other. Structuralism was an early attempt to understand the human mind through introspection, which involved examining oneâ€™s own thoughts and experiences systematically.
