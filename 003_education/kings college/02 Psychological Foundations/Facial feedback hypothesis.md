The Facial Feedback Hypothesis is a concept in psychology that suggests that the **physical expressions of an emotion can affect the experience of that emotion itself.**

## Overview

- This hypothesis proposes that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion. In other words, smiling can make you feel happier, and frowning can make you feel sadder.
- The facial feedback hypothesis supports the broader theory of the somatic marker hypothesis, which suggests that bodily (or somatic) responses are integral to emotions and decision-making.

## Experiments and Evidence

- **Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988)**: In a well-known experiment, participants held a pen in their mouth to either encourage a smile (without them realising it) or a neutral expression. Those induced to smile reported finding a cartoon funnier than the neutral expression group, supporting the facial feedback hypothesis.
- **Botox Studies**: Studies have found that the use of Botox, which inhibits facial expressions, can affect the emotional experience. These studies provide additional support for the facial feedback hypothesis.

## Criticisms and Limitations

- Some replication attempts of the original studies supporting the facial feedback hypothesis have failed, leading to ongoing debates about the robustness and universality of this effect.
- There’s also a question of the extent to which this phenomenon applies. While it may influence our emotional state, it’s unlikely to be the sole or primary driver of our emotional experiences.
