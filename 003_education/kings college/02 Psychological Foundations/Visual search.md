1. **Parallel Search**: In this type, all information in the visual field is processed simultaneously. The target, if present, is immediately recognised irrespective of the number of distractor items. An example could be identifying a red dot in a field of blue dots.

 2. **Serial Search:** This refers to sequentially scanning and processing individual items in a visual field until the target is found. This process is typically slower, and the time it takes increases linearly with the number of items. An example could be looking for a specific word in a paragraph.

3. **Feature Search**: This type of search involves looking for a specific attribute or feature (such as colour, shape, or orientation) among other stimuli. The feature often ‘pops out’, and the search can usually be done in parallel. For example, finding a yellow balloon among a bunch of blue balloons.

4. **Conjunction Search**: This search involves finding a target defined by a combination of features. It typically requires a serial search, as each item has to be checked for multiple features. For example, finding a red square among red circles and blue squares.

## Important Points

- These theories are simplified models of how our visual system and attention might work. The actual processes are likely much more complex, involving interactions between different brain areas and a mix of top-down (knowledge-driven) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) processes.
- The way we search visually can be influenced by our expectations, past experiences, the complexity of the visual scene, and the specifics of the search task at hand.
