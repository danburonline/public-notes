The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve is a **concept in psychology that describes the rate at which information is forgotten over time if it is not actively reviewed or rehearsed.** The curve is named after Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who first studied this phenomenon in the late 19th century.

> The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve demonstrates that **memory retention declines exponentially** after initial learning—within the first 24 hours, you can lose up to 60% of newly acquired information if it’s not reviewed. Regular review and spaced repetition are essential to slow down this decline and improve long-term retention.
