Extinction [[Operant learning|Learning]] is a type of learning in which a **previously learned behaviour or response is reduced or extinguished when it is no longer reinforced.** This type of learning is commonly seen in [[classical conditioning]], where a conditioned response is no longer elicited when the conditioned stimulus is no longer paired with an unconditioned stimulus. Extinction learning can also occur in operant conditioning, where behaviour is no longer reinforced and eventually stops occurring.
