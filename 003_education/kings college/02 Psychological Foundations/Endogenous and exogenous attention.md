Endogenous and exogenous attention refers to **two types of attentional control:** the ability to direct focus and ignore irrelevant stimuli.

1. **Endogenous Attention:** This is also known as voluntary attention. It’s goal-directed, meaning it’s under conscious control and is typically driven by internal cues, desires, or goals. For example, when you choose to concentrate on studying for a test or focus on a conversation in a crowded room, you are using endogenous attention. The defining characteristic of endogenous attention is that the individual directs it based on their current goals or tasks.

2. **Exogenous Attention:** This is also known as reflexive or involuntary attention. It’s stimulus-driven, meaning that external events or stimuli automatically capture it without your conscious control. For example, when a loud noise or a sudden flash of light catches your attention, you’re experiencing exogenous attention. The defining characteristic of exogenous attention is that it’s directed by external stimuli rather than by an individual’s goals or tasks.
