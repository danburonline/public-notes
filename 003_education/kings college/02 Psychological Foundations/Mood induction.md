Mood induction is a procedure used in experimental psychology to **elicit certain emotional states in participants.** It’s a widely used method in studies involving affective disorders, emotion regulation, and the impact of mood states on cognitive processes.

**Types of Mood Induction:**

1. **Music Induction:** This method uses music pieces with a known emotional tone to induce a specific mood. For instance, cheerful music can be used to induce a happy mood, and slow, minor-key music can be used to induce a sad mood.
2. **Imagery Induction:** This method uses mental imagery scripts, often read by participants, to elicit specific emotional responses. For example, participants might be asked to visualise a relaxing beach scene to induce a calm mood.
3. **Film Clip Induction:** Film clips with emotional content are used to provoke emotional responses in the viewers.
4. **Velten Induction:** In this method, participants read self-referential statements (Velten mood induction statements) that start neutral and gradually become either more positive or negative.

**Factors Influencing Effectiveness:**
- **Individual Differences:** People’s reactions to mood induction procedures can differ based on their personality, current mood, and other individual factors.
- **Context:** The effectiveness of a mood induction procedure can depend on the context in which it is used.

**Uses in Research:**
Mood induction procedures are used to study a variety of topics in psychology and neuroscience, including the impact of mood on memory, attention, decision-making, and other cognitive processes. They’re also used in clinical psychology research to understand mood disorders better.

**Caveat:**
Researchers must be careful when inducing negative moods, as this can potentially cause [[distress]] to participants. Ethics and participant welfare must always be prioritised.
