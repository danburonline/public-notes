Morgan's Canon is a principle that suggests **simpler explanations for animal behaviour should be favoured over complex ones.** It discourages attributing complex cognitive processes to animals when simpler explanations are available. For instance, a dog barking when its owner comes home may not necessarily indicate joy but could simply be the dog seeking attention or alerting the owner of its presence.

## Historical Context

Proposed by British psychologist **C. Lloyd Morgan** in 1894, the principle emerged as a corrective to Victorian-era anthropomorphism in animal psychology. It's often considered an application of [Occam's razor](../../../001_private/_%20general%20knowledge/Occam%27s%20razor.md) to comparative cognition.

> [!caution] Limitation
> Morgan's Canon risks systematic underestimation of animal cognition. Parsimony is a methodological preference, not a truth criterion—simpler explanations aren't necessarily correct.
