Functional introspection refers to a **method of studying mental processes by analysing one’s own subjective experiences and reporting them systematically and scientifically.** It is a technique used to explore one’s own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions to gain insight into the workings of the mind.

Functional introspection is rooted in the field of introspectionism, which was popularised by early psychologists such as [Wilhelm Wundt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt) and [Edward Titchener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener). It involves training individuals to observe and report on their own mental processes, including sensations, emotions, and thoughts.
