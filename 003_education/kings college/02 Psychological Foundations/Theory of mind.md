The theory of mind is the **cognitive ability to understand and attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions, to oneself and others.** It involves recognising that people have different perspectives, thoughts, and feelings and using that understanding to interpret and predict behaviour. This ability is typically developed in humans during early childhood and plays a fundamental role in social interactions and communication. An understanding of the theory of mind is also crucial to help us to emphasise with others.

## How to Test if a Child Developed the Theory of Mind

The [Sally–Anne test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test) is a commonly used **experimental task in developmental psychology that assesses a child’s understanding of the theory of mind.** In the test, two characters, Sally and Anne, are introduced, along with a box and a basket. Sally has a marble, which she places inside the box and leaves the scene. Anne then moves the marble from the box to the basket while Sally is away. **The key question is: Where will Sally look for her marble when she returns?**

Typically, children below the age of 4 or 5 will answer that Sally will look in the basket because they can only consider the current state of affairs. In contrast, children above this age range will correctly answer that Sally will look in the box, recognising that Sally has a different mind and therefore memory the marble’s location.
