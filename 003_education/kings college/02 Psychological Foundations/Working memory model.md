The **working memory model**, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974, describes [[Short-term memory|short-term memory]] as comprising three components: the [[Central executive|central executive]], the [[Phonological loop|phonological loop]], and the [[Visuospatial sketchpad|visuospatial sketchpad]].

The **central executive** controls and coordinates the other two components. The **phonological loop** stores and rehearses verbal information, while the **visuospatial sketchpad** stores and manipulates visual information.
