- [[Behaviourism|Neobehaviourism]], particularly the **work of Edward Tolman,** emphasises the active, goal-directed nature of behaviour and the role of internal cognitive processes.
- Purposive behaviour is goal-directed **behaviour driven by an individual’s internal mental processes,** including expectations, beliefs, and intentions.
- Tolman **rejected the stimulus-response association** approach of classical behaviourism and proposed that cognitive factors influence behaviour.
- Tolman conducted **experiments with rats in mazes** and observed that they developed cognitive maps, mental representations of the labyrinth.
- Purposive behaviour involves **setting goals, formulating cognitive maps, and anticipating outcomes** to guide behaviour.
- Animals and humans engage in purposive behaviour by using **internal representations to plan and execute behaviour** towards desired goals.

## Key Points

1. Neobehaviorism emphasises the active, goal-directed nature of behaviour.
2. Internal mental processes drive purposive behaviour.
3. Tolman’s experiments with rats in mazes highlighted the development of cognitive maps.
4. Cognitive maps help anticipate outcomes and guide behaviour towards goals.
5. Purposive behaviour involves goal-setting and using internal representations to plan actions.
