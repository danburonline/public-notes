Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that **studies the structure of experience and consciousness.** It focuses on understanding **how people experience the world and how their experiences shape their understanding of the world.** Phenomenology is concerned with the subjective aspects of experience, such as how people perceive, interpret, and remember events. It is also concerned with the **relationship between the individual and the world, including how people interact and make sense of their environment.** Phenomenology is closely related to other philosophical disciplines such as existentialism, [[hermeneutics]], and existential psychology.

## Key Figures

- **Edmund Husserl** (1859-1938): Founder of phenomenology. Introduced the concept of **intentionality**—that consciousness is always directed at something—and the method of **bracketing** (epoché), suspending natural assumptions to examine experience directly.
- **Martin Heidegger** (1889-1976): Extended phenomenology to examine **being-in-the-world**, emphasising how human existence is always situated within a context of practical engagement.
- **Maurice Merleau-Ponty** (1908-1961): Developed **embodied phenomenology**, arguing that perception and consciousness are fundamentally rooted in bodily experience.

## Connection to Consciousness Studies

Phenomenology provides methodological tools for studying [[Access and phenomenal consciousness|subjective experience]]. The challenge of bridging first-person phenomenological description with third-person neuroscience is addressed by [[Naturalisation of phenomenology]], which seeks to integrate phenomenological insights with empirical research. The question of whether functional equivalence guarantees experiential equivalence connects to debates about [[Philosophical zombies]].
