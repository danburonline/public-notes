Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that **studies the structure of experience and consciousness.** It focuses on understanding **how people experience the world and how their experiences shape their understanding of the world.** Phenomenology is concerned with the subjective aspects of experience, such as how people perceive, interpret, and remember events. It is also concerned with the **relationship between the individual and the world, including how people interact and make sense of their environment.** Phenomenology is closely related to other philosophical disciplines such as existentialism, hermeneutics, and existential psychology.
