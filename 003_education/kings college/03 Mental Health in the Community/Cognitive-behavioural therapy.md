Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a **form of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.** It aims to help individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to their problems and improve their mental health and well-being. CBT is often used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic [[Stress]] disorder (PTSD).

## Core Techniques

CBT employs several key therapeutic techniques:

- **Cognitive restructuring**: Identifying and challenging distorted thoughts through [[Appraisal|cognitive appraisal]] and reframing
- **Behavioural activation**: Increasing engagement in positive activities to counteract [[Distress]]
- **Exposure therapy**: Gradual confrontation of feared stimuli to reduce avoidance
- **Problem-solving training**: Developing systematic approaches to address life challenges

## Theoretical Foundations

CBT integrates cognitive and behavioural traditions, grounded in the idea that maladaptive cognitions maintain emotional disturbance. The [[Diathesis-stress model]] provides a framework for understanding how cognitive vulnerabilities interact with environmental stressors to trigger disorders. Unlike purely pharmacological approaches (see [[Psychiatry vs psychology]]), CBT emphasises building long-term coping skills.

## Evidence Base

CBT has robust empirical support across multiple conditions, including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate effect sizes comparable to or exceeding medication, with lower relapse rates following treatment discontinuation.
