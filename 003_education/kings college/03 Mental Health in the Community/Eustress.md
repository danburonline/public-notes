Eustress refers to **positive [stress](Stress.md)**—the beneficial form of physiological and psychological arousal that arises when challenges are perceived as manageable and meaningful. Unlike [distress](Distress.md), eustress promotes adaptation, growth, and enhanced performance.

## Characteristics

- **Perceived controllability**: The stressor feels within one's capacity to influence or overcome
- **Short-term duration**: Typically acute rather than chronic
- **Motivational quality**: Energises rather than depletes
- **Meaning-laden**: Connected to goals, values, or personal significance

## Neurobiological mechanisms

Eustress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis similarly to distress, releasing cortisol and adrenaline. However, the key differences lie in:

1. **Dopaminergic engagement**: Eustress triggers reward-anticipation pathways, releasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex
2. **Moderate cortisol release**: Sufficient to enhance alertness and memory consolidation without the prolonged elevation seen in chronic distress
3. **Neuroplasticity promotion**: Acute, manageable stress can enhance synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis

## Yerkes-Dodson relationship

Eustress operates within the optimal zone of the Yerkes-Dodson curve, where arousal enhances performance. Too little arousal leads to boredom and disengagement; too much tips into [distress](Distress.md) and impairment.

## Examples

- Starting a new job or academic programme
- Preparing for a challenging presentation
- Training for athletic competition
- Learning a complex new skill
- Creative deadlines with adequate resources

## Clinical relevance

The [Diathesis-stress model](Diathesis-stress%20model.md) traditionally emphasises vulnerability to distress, but eustress research suggests that the same diathesis may also determine an individual's capacity to benefit from positive challenges—a concept sometimes called "vantage sensitivity" or differential susceptibility.
