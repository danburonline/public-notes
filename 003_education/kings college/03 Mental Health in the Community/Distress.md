**Distress is negative [[stress]].** It happens when challenges exceed your ability to cope, leading to feelings of anxiety or discomfort. It can have negative effects on both mental and physical health. Examples include extreme workload, loss of a loved one, or traumatic events.

## Physiological Responses

Distress activates the **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis**, leading to sustained cortisol release. Unlike acute stress, chronic distress keeps cortisol elevated, which can impair:
- Immune function
- Memory consolidation (hippocampal damage)
- Cardiovascular health

## Psychological Effects

- Anxiety and depression
- Cognitive impairment (difficulty concentrating)
- Emotional dysregulation
- Sleep disturbances

## Contrast with Eustress

Unlike [[Eustress]] (positive stress that motivates and improves performance), distress is characterised by feeling overwhelmed rather than challenged. The [[Diathesis-stress model]] explains how individual vulnerabilities interact with stressors to produce negative outcomes. [[Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] is an effective intervention for managing distress responses.
