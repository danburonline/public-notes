The Diathesis-Stress Model is a psychological theory that suggests that **mental disorders arise from the interaction between a person's predisposition or vulnerability (diathesis) and stressful life events (stress).** The model proposes that individuals with a higher diathesis require less stress to trigger a disorder, while those with a lower diathesis require more stress. It is commonly used to explain the development of disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.
