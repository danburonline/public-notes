Psychoanalysis, developed by [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) in the late 19th century, is a **therapeutic approach rooted in the idea that individuals are often unaware of many factors that influence their emotions and behaviours.** These unconscious factors can create unhappiness, manifesting as seemingly inexplicable feelings, problematic patterns of behaviour, or difficulties in relationships. Through techniques like dream interpretation, free association, and analysis of transference, psychoanalysis seeks to uncover these hidden aspects of the psyche to understand and resolve psychological problems.

The therapy often involves several sessions a week over several years, allowing the individual and the analyst to dive deep into the complexities of the unconscious mind. It pays particular attention to how early life experiences, especially those related to primary caregivers, shape an individualâ€™s present behaviour, thoughts, and feelings. This introspective process can bring about significant personal growth and self-understanding, helping individuals to lead more fulfilling lives.

Compared to modern therapeutic treatments like [[Cognitive-behavioural therapy]], psychoanalysis requires a greater time commitment and delves deeper into past experiences and unconscious drives.
