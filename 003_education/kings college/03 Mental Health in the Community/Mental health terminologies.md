1. **Mental Health Issues/Problems**: These are challenges or difficulties related to mental or emotional well-being. They could be temporary responses to stress or a symptom of a more persistent mental disorder. However, the term "issues" or "problems" doesn't always imply a diagnosable mental disorder.
2. **Mental Disorders**: These are diagnosable conditions characterised by changes in thinking, mood, or behaviour, which cause distress or impaired function. Established diagnostic criteria, such as those in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), typically define them.
3. **Psychiatric Disorders**: This term is used interchangeably with "mental disorders." It tends to be used more in clinical or medical contexts and emphasises these conditions' biological and medical aspects. It includes disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.
4. **Emotional Distress**: This term refers to a highly unpleasant emotional reaction (for example, anxiety or depression), whether it's due to a mental disorder, a stressful event, or other life circumstances. Emotional distress may not necessarily mean a person has a mental disorder but could indicate a need for psychological support.
5. **Psychological Disorders**: Another term for "mental disorders" is often used to underscore these conditions' psychological and cognitive aspects. It includes conditions like anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
6. **Behavioural Disorders**: These are a subset of mental disorders where a person's behaviour is the primary symptom or cause of dysfunction. Behavioural disorders typically emerge in childhood or adolescence, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorder.
7. **Neurodevelopmental Disorders**: These are disorders that begin in early childhood and impact normal brain development and function. They include conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and learning disorders.
8. **Mental Health Conditions**: This is a broad, umbrella term that encompasses both diagnosable mental disorders as well as other issues or problems related to mental health. It's a neutral term often used in public health and advocacy contexts.
9. **Mental Illness**: This term is frequently used interchangeably with "mental disorders" and "psychiatric disorders." However, the term "mental illness" can sometimes carry a heavier stigma due to its association with severe and often misunderstood conditions. It generally refers to a wide range of mental health conditions that affect mood, thinking, and behaviour. These may include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and many others.
