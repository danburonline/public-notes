The concept of conscious veto is derived from the pioneering work of neuroscientist [Benjamin Libet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet). It refers to **the ability of individuals to consciously inhibit or veto an action that their brain has prepared to execute.** This phenomenon is often described as **“free won’t,”** in contrast to “free will.”

## Libet’s Experiments

In the 1980s, Libet conducted experiments that investigated the timing of conscious intentions and actions. Participants were asked to perform simple movements, such as flexing their wrist, while their brain activity was monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). Libet discovered a pattern called the [[readiness potential]] (RP), a measurable rise in brain activity that occurs approximately 550 milliseconds before the actual movement.

### Key Findings

1. **Readiness Potential (RP)**: This rise in brain activity was observed about 550 milliseconds before the action.
2. **Conscious Intention**: Participants reported becoming consciously aware of their intention to move about 200 milliseconds before the action occurred.

## The Role of Conscious Veto

Libet proposed that while the initiation of an action appears to be governed by unconscious brain processes, individuals still retain the ability to consciously veto or inhibit these actions in the final moments before they are carried out. This conscious veto capability suggests that even though unconscious brain activity may prepare and initiate actions, our conscious mind can intervene to prevent certain actions from being executed.

### Implications for Free Will

The concept of conscious veto has significant implications for our understanding of free will and moral responsibility. It indicates a role for conscious decision-making in controlling our actions, even if it does not initiate them. This suggests that while our actions might be prepared by unconscious processes, our conscious self has the final say in whether or not those actions are carried out.
