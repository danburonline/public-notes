Apoptosis, also known as **programmed cell death**, is a critical **process in which cells systematically dismantle themselves in a controlled and regulated manner.** This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for the development and health of multicellular organisms.

## Apoptosis vs. Necrosis

- **Apoptosis:** A controlled, energy-dependent process characterised by cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation.
- **Necrosis:** Uncontrolled cell death due to external factors like trauma or infection, resulting in cellular swelling, rupture, and inflammation.

## Significance

Apoptosis plays a vital role in the nervous system across various stages of life:
- **Developmental Stages:** Apoptosis is crucial for the development of the nervous system. It helps in the elimination of excess neurons, thereby refining neural circuits and ensuring proper neural development.
- **Adult Brain:** In the mature nervous system, apoptosis is important for removing damaged or diseased neurons and preventing potential detrimental effects on neighbouring cells and overall brain function.
