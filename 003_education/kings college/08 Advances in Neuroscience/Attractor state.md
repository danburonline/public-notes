An attractor state refers to a **set of points in the [[Phase space and phasing rotator||phase space]] toward which a system tends to evolve**, regardless of its initial state. This concept is crucial in understanding the stable and recurrent patterns in neural signal processing.

## Definition of Attractor State

- **Attractors** are stable states or sets of states that a dynamic system approaches over time. These can be points, cycles, or more complex structures.

## Types of Attractors

- **Point Attractors**: Represent a stable equilibrium state where the system settles into a single steady state.
- **Limit Cycles**: Denote periodic orbits; the system returns to the same trajectory after a period.
- **Chaotic Attractors**: Indicate irregular yet bounded trajectories, leading to deterministic but unpredictable behaviour.

## Application in Neural Signal Processing

- **Modeling Neural Dynamics**: Attractors are used to model how neural circuits stabilise to a particular function or behaviour, such as memory or pattern recognition.
- **Understanding Neural Connectivity**: Attractor dynamics can help explain how neural networks achieve synchronisation and how different neural states are maintained.
- **Signal Classification**: Identifying attractor states in neural signals can help distinguish between different cognitive states or diagnose neurological conditions.
