The neurogenic niche refers to **specialised regions in the brain that support the growth and differentiation of new neurons throughout life**. This concept is pivotal in understanding brain plasticity and regeneration.

## Definition of Neurogenic Niche

- **Neurogenic Niches**: Specific areas in the brain where [[neurogenesis]] (the process of generating new neurons) occurs. These niches provide a supportive environment with the necessary cellular and molecular components.

## Key Locations

- **Subventricular Zone (SVZ)**: Located along the lateral ventricles, this area is a major source of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.
- **Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG)**: Another primary site of adult [[neurogenesis]], important for learning and memory processes.

## Functions of Neurogenic Niches

- **Brain Plasticity**: Supports the brain’s ability to adapt to new information, experiences, and injuries.
- **Cognitive Function**: Influences learning and memory, particularly in how new memories are formed and old ones are stabilised.
- **Response to Injury**: Plays a role in brain repair mechanisms, providing new cells that can replace damaged neurons.

## Application in Neuroscience

- **Research and Therapy**: Studying neurogenic niches has implications for treating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and brain injuries.
- **Regenerative Medicine**: Enhancing or mimicking the conditions of neurogenic niches could lead to breakthroughs in regenerative therapies for various neurodegenerative disorders.
