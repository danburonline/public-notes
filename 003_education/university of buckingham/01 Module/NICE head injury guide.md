## Key Principles

*   **ABCDE First:** Always prioritise Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure before focusing on the head injury itself.  Hypoxia and hypotension worsen secondary brain injury.
*   **Systematic Approach:** Follow a structured approach (e.g., ATLS) for all trauma patients.
*   **Early Senior Involvement:** For significant head injuries (especially GCS ≤ 8), involve senior clinicians early.
*   **Safeguarding:** Always consider the possibility of non-accidental injury, especially in children. Document and escalate any concerns.

## Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

*   Report *both* the total score (out of 15) *and* the individual components (E, V, M).
*   Paediatric GCS: Use the modified version for preverbal children (includes "grimace").
*   Baseline GCS: Establish pre-injury GCS if possible (e.g., dementia, learning disability).

## Pre-Hospital

*   **Remote Advice (e.g., NHS 111):**
    *   **999 Referral (Ambulance):**
        *   Unconsciousness/lack of full consciousness.
        *   Focal neurological deficit.
        *   Suspected complex skull fracture/penetrating injury.
        *   Seizure.
        *   High-energy mechanism.
        * No way to safely transfer to Hospital.
    *   **Emergency Department Referral (not necessarily 999):**
        *   *Any* loss of consciousness (even if recovered).
        *   Amnesia.
        *   Persistent headache.
        *   Vomiting.
        *   Previous brain surgery.
        *   Bleeding/clotting disorders.
        *   Current anticoagulant/antiplatelet (except aspirin monotherapy).
        *   Drug/alcohol intoxication.
        *   Safeguarding concerns.
        *   Continuing concern by helpline staff.
*   **Community Health Services (GPs, walk-in centres):** Similar referral criteria to above, but also:
    *   GCS %3C 15 on initial assessment.
    *   If no other concerning features, consider referral based on: irritability/altered behavior (esp. under 5s), concerning visible trauma, no one to observe at home.
* **Tranexamic Acid:**
	* **GCS ≤12 *and* no active *extracranial* bleeding.**
	* Give within 2 hrs.
	* **16 and over:** 2g IV bolus.
	* **Under 16:** 15 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg (max 2g) IV bolus.
*   **Transport:** Direct to major trauma centre or trauma unit with appropriate resources.
*   **NO Direct Access Imaging:** Patients should *not* be referred for neuroimaging directly from the community.

## Emergency Department Assessment

*   **Triage:** Assess within 15 minutes of arrival.
*   **Assume Traumatic Brain Injury:** Until proven otherwise, do *not* attribute depressed consciousness solely to intoxication.
*   **Pain Management:** Essential to prevent raised ICP.

### Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets (All Ages)

*   **Consider** CT even with *no other indications* if on:
    *   Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin).
    *   DOACs (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban).
    *   Heparin (LMWH or UFH).
    *   Antiplatelets (excluding aspirin monotherapy).
*   **Timing:**
     *  Within 8 hours of injury *or*
     *  Within 1 hour of presentation if presenting *more* than 8 hours after the injury.
*   **Aspirin Monotherapy:**  Can be discharged without CT if no other indications and shared decision making.

## CT Cervical Spine Criteria

### Adults (16 and over) - *Immediate* CT (within 1 hour)

*   GCS ≤ 12.
*   Intubated.
*   Definitive diagnosis of C-spine injury urgently needed (e.g., for surgery).

    *   Age ≥ 65.
    *   Dangerous mechanism.
    *   Focal peripheral neurological deficit.
    *   Paraesthesia (upper or lower limbs).
*   Neck pain/tenderness AND no high-risk factors, BUT:
  * Unsafe to assess range of movement, *OR*
  * Cannot actively rotate neck 45 degrees left and right.

* Unsafe to assess range of movement
* Condition predisposes to injury
*If cannot actively rotate neck 45 degrees left/right, do X-rays.

## MRI

*   **Not** for primary investigation of acute TBI.
*   Consider *after* CT if neurological abnormality attributable to spinal cord injury.
*   Consider for assessing ligamentous/disc injuries.
*   Consider CT or MRI angiography if suspicion of vascular injury (e.g., vertebral malalignment).

## Admission Criteria

*   New, clinically important abnormality on imaging (but isolated, simple, linear, non-depressed skull fracture alone is *unlikely* to be clinically important, unless on anticoagulants)
*   GCS not returned to 15 (or pre-injury baseline) after imaging.
*   Indication for CT but scan cannot be done in appropriate timeframe.
*   Continuing worrying symptoms (e.g., persistent vomiting, severe headache).
*   Other concerns (e.g., drug/alcohol intoxication, other injuries, safeguarding concerns).

## Observation

*   **Minimum Observations:** GCS, pupil size/reactivity, limb movements, respiratory rate, heart rate, BP, temperature, oxygen saturation.
*   **Frequency (if GCS < 15):**
    *   Half-hourly until GCS = 15.
* **Frequency (if GCS =15):**
	* Half-hourly for 2 hours
	* 1 hourly for 4 hours
	* 2 hourly
*   **Revert to half-hourly** if GCS deteriorates.
*   **Urgent Reassessment:** If agitation, abnormal behaviour, sustained drop in GCS (esp. motor score), severe/increasing headache, new neurological signs.
* **Babies/Children under 5:** Observation is difficult. Only observe in units experienced in this age group.

## Discharge

*   Only if GCS = 15 (or back to pre-injury baseline), *and* no other concerning factors, *and* suitable supervision at home.
*   **Discharge Advice:** Verbal *and* written, to patient *and* responsible adult.  Include:
    *   Nature and severity of injury.
    *   Red flags requiring return to ED.
    *   Recovery process and potential for delayed complications.
    *   Contact details for support.
    *   Advice on return to activities (school, work, sports, driving).
* **Letter to GP:** Within 48 hours. Also send to health visitor (preschool) and school nurse (school-age).

## Transfer to Neuroscience Unit

*   Local guidelines should exist.
*   Consider occult extracranial injuries.
*   Intubate and ventilate if GCS ≤ 8, or other specific indications (loss of airway reflexes, respiratory insufficiency, irregular respirations, significantly deteriorating consciousness, unstable facial fractures, copious bleeding into mouth, seizures).
* **Paediatric Transfer:** Follow NHS England service specification and Paediatric Critical Care Society standards.

## Hypopituitarism

* Any head injury severity.
* Can be immediate or delayed.
* Consider in patients with low sodium or low BP
* Investigate or refer if symptomatic.
