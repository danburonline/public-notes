Wafer in brain surgery refer to **small, biodegradable discs (most commonly Gliadel® wafers) that deliver chemotherapy directly to the brain after tumor removal.** They are primarily used to treat certain types of brain tumours, such as glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas.

## How Wafers Work

- **Composition:** Each wafer contains the chemotherapy drug carmustine (BCNU) embedded in a biodegradable polymer.
- **Placement:** During surgery, up to eight wafers are placed in the cavity left after tumour removal.
- **Drug Delivery:** The wafers slowly dissolve over 2–3 weeks, releasing carmustine directly into the surrounding brain tissue.
- **Mechanism:** Carmustine disrupts the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing and causing cell death.

## Clinical Benefits

- **Targeted Therapy:** High concentration of chemotherapy at the tumour site.
- **Reduced Side Effects:** Fewer systemic effects compared to intravenous chemotherapy.
- **No Removal Needed:** Wafers are fully biodegradable and do not require a second surgery for removal.

## Indications

- **Primary Use:** Adults with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
- **Adjunct Therapy:** Often used alongside surgery and sometimes with radiation therapy.
