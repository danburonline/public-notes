The neocortex – also called the neopallium, isocortex – is the **outer layer of the brain, consisting of folded grey matter that is responsible for higher brain functions** such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language. It is found in mammals and is particularly well-developed in humans.
