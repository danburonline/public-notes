Readiness [Potential](../04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Graded%20potential.md) (RP), also known as Bereitschaftspotential, is a **brain signal that precedes voluntary movements.** It is related to the preparation or intention to perform an action.

## Overview

- **First identified:** In the 1960s by Kornhuber and Deecke
- **Electroencephalography (EEG):** It’s typically detected via EEG, a neuroimaging technique that measures electrical activity in the brain
- **Time frame:** RP can occur anywhere from 500 milliseconds to 2 seconds before the conscious decision to move

## Characteristics

- **Two main parts:** RP is often divided into two parts: the early RP (starting ~1.5 seconds before the movement) and the late RP (starting ~400 milliseconds before the movement)
- **Location:** More prominent in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-SMA of the brain
- **Function:** Suggested to reflect the preparatory processes that facilitate voluntary movement

## Controversy

- **Free will debate:** The discovery of RP has sparked a debate on free will, as some interpret it as evidence that our brains decide to move before we’re consciously aware of the decision

## Current Research

- **Prediction of movement:** Researchers are exploring how RP can be used to predict movement, which could be particularly useful in neuroprosthetics
- **Understanding cognitive processes:** RP is also studied to further understand cognitive processes related to the planning and initiation of actions
