Hyperfrontality refers to **increased activity or overactivity in the brain’s frontal lobes.**

## Function of Frontal Lobes

- The frontal lobes are critical for a variety of functions, including:
  - Problem-solving
  - [Memory](../02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Working%20memory%20model.md)
  - Language
  - Judgment
  - Impulse control
  - Social and emotional behaviour

## Clinical Significance

- Hyperfrontality is often observed in various neurological or psychiatric conditions.

## Associated Disorders

- Disorders often linked with hyperfrontality include:
  - **Schizophrenia**: Characterised by abnormal social behaviour and failure to recognise reality.
  - **[Bipolar](../03%20Mental%20Health%20in%20the%20Community/Spectrum%20of%20bipolar%20disorder.md) Disorder**: Involves episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs.
  - **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**: Characterised by unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) leading to compulsive behaviours.

## Diagnostic Tools

- Brain imaging techniques are commonly used to study hyperfrontality, such as:
  - **Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)**: Allows for observing brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow.
