Microglia cells are **specialised immune cells in the brain with a variety of functions** essential for [central nervous system](../04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Central%20nervous%20system.md) (CNS) homeostasis and health:

- **Surveillant Microglia**: These cells constantly **scan the brain microenvironment** to detect minor changes and maintain CNS homeostasis.
  - They are vigilant against **neurotoxic substances** and **inflammatory mediators** coming from the systemic circulation.
- **Phagocytic Microglia**: Their role is to **detect and remove damaged or dying neurons**.
  - This prevents damage to neighbouring cells and supports the high turnover of specific neuronal populations.
- **[Pruning](../04%20Biological%20Foundations%20of%20Mental%20Health/Synaptic%20pruning%20and%20apoptosis.md) Microglia**: They are responsible for the **removal of superfluous synapses** in neuronal pathways.
  - This pruning is crucial for the development and maintenance of efficient neural circuits.
- **Neuromodulatory Microglia**: They exert a **modulatory influence at synapses**, affecting neuronal activity.
  - This modulation can be direct or indirect, impacting the overall functioning of neural networks.
