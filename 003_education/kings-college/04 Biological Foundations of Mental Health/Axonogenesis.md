Axonogenesis refers to the **process by which neurons in the developing nervous system generate and extend their axons**. It involves a combination of cell migration, axon outgrowth, and guidance cues that guide the axons to their intended targets. Axonogenesis plays a crucial role in establishing the neural circuitry necessary for proper brain function.
