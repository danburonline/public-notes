Social cognition is the study of **how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations.** It focuses on the role of cognitive processes in social interactions, including how people form impressions of others, make decisions, and navigate social environments. Research in this area has been used to understand and explain various social phenomena, such as prejudice, stereotyping, and interpersonal relationships.
