Generalisation Gradient generally refers to **the concept in learning and memory research that describes how well an organism, such as a human or an animal, can generalise learning from a specific stimulus** or situation to other related stimuli or situations. In other words, it represents the degree to which learning in one context can be applied or transferred to other contexts.
