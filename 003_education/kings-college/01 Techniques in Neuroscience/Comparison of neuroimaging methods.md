Neuroimaging techniques occupy different positions in a trade-off space defined by **spatial resolution**, **temporal resolution**, and **subject tolerance requirements**. No single modality excels across all dimensions—method selection depends on the research question and population.

## Technique Comparison

| Technique | Temporal Resolution | Spatial Resolution | Infant Tolerance |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| EEG / ERP | High (ms) | Low | High |
| MEG | High (ms) | Moderate | High |
| NIRS | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| PET | Low (min) | High | Low |
| fMRI / DTI | Low (s) | High | Low |

## Trade-off Dimensions

### Temporal vs Spatial Resolution

Techniques with high temporal resolution (EEG, MEG) measure electrical/magnetic activity directly but suffer from the inverse problem—inferring source locations from scalp recordings is mathematically ill-posed. Haemodynamic methods (fMRI, PET, NIRS) offer superior anatomical localisation but measure blood flow changes that lag neural activity by seconds.

### Infant Tolerance

The diagonal axis represents practical constraints for developmental research:

- **High tolerance techniques** (EEG, MEG, NIRS): Portable, quiet, movement-tolerant. Essential for studying awake, behaving infants.
- **Low tolerance techniques** (fMRI, PET): Require stillness in confined, loud environments. PET additionally involves radioactive tracers, making it unsuitable for healthy paediatric populations.

## Clinical and Research Applications

| Technique | Typical Applications |
|-----------|---------------------|
| EEG/ERP | Sleep studies, epilepsy monitoring, cognitive event timing |
| MEG | Pre-surgical mapping, language lateralisation |
| NIRS | Bedside monitoring, infant cognition studies |
| PET | Neurodegenerative disease, receptor mapping |
| fMRI/DTI | Functional localisation, white matter tractography |
