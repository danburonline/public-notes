Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a **form of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.** It aims to help individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to their problems and improve their mental health and well-being. CBT is often used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic [Stress](Stress.md) disorder (PTSD).

## Core Techniques

CBT employs several key therapeutic techniques:

- **Cognitive restructuring**: Identifying and challenging distorted thoughts through [cognitive appraisal](../02%20Psychological%20Foundations/Appraisal.md) and reframing
- **Behavioural activation**: Increasing engagement in positive activities to counteract [Distress](Distress.md)
- **Exposure therapy**: Gradual confrontation of feared stimuli to reduce avoidance
- **Problem-solving training**: Developing systematic approaches to address life challenges

## Theoretical Foundations

CBT integrates cognitive and behavioural traditions, grounded in the idea that maladaptive cognitions maintain emotional disturbance. The [Diathesis-stress model](Diathesis-stress%20model.md) provides a framework for understanding how cognitive vulnerabilities interact with environmental stressors to trigger disorders. Unlike purely pharmacological approaches (see [Psychiatry vs psychology](Psychiatry%20vs%20psychology.md)), CBT emphasises building long-term coping skills.

## Evidence Base

CBT has robust empirical support across multiple conditions, including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate effect sizes comparable to or exceeding medication, with lower relapse rates following treatment discontinuation.
