The refractory periods refer to **the time following an action potential during which the neuron is less responsive or completely unresponsive to stimulus.** There are two types: the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period.

## Absolute Refractory Period

The absolute refractory period occurs immediately after an action potential.

- During this period, the neuron cannot produce another action potential, regardless of the strength of a second stimulus.
- This is because the voltage-gated sodium channels, which are necessary for the initiation of an action potential, are inactivated.
- The absolute refractory period lasts about 1â€“2 milliseconds and ensures that action potentials move in one direction along the axon, from the cell body towards the axon terminals.

## Relative Refractory Period

The relative refractory period follows the absolute refractory period.

- During this time, the neuron can produce another action potential, but only in response to a stimulus that is stronger than usual.
- This is because the neuron is hyperpolarised during this period, and a stronger stimulus is needed to reach the threshold potential.
- The relative refractory period lasts until the membrane potential returns to its resting state.
- It serves to limit the number of action potentials that can be produced in a given time period and influences the timing and frequency of action potential firing.
