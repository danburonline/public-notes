Pluripotentiality refers to the **capability of certain types of cells, notably stem cells, to differentiate into any other type of cell in the body.** This is a characteristic that is crucial in areas like regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

## Levels of [[Summary of extracellular recordings|Cellular]] Potency

- **Totipotent** cells: Can differentiate into all possible cell types. An example is the fertilised egg (zygote) and the cells produced by the first few divisions of the zygote.
- **Pluripotent** cells: These can give rise to all the cell types that make up the body. Examples include cells found in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
- **Multipotent** cells: Can differentiate into a number of cells, but these are limited to a specific lineage (e.g., blood stem cells).
- **Unipotent** cells: Can only produce cells of their own type, but they have the property of self-renewal required to be classified as stem cells.

## Importance in Medicine

Pluripotent cells can potentially be used in regenerative medicine to create new, healthy cells to replace damaged or diseased ones. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, with new findings being released regularly.
