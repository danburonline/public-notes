## Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are endogenous **chemicals that enable neurotransmission.** They transmit signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another target neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell.

### Key Features

- They are synthesised in neurons.
- Stored in synaptic vesicles.
- Released into the synaptic cleft in response to an action potential.
- Directly trigger a response in the target cell.
- Examples: Glutamate, GABA, Dopamine, Serotonin, Acetylcholine, Norepinephrine.

## Neuromodulators

Neuromodulators are a **type of neurotransmitter that regulate or modify the effects of neurotransmitters instead of directly triggering an immediate response** in a post-synaptic cell.

### Key Features

- They can act on multiple neurons simultaneously, not just the immediate neighbouring cells.
- Effects are usually slower and longer-lasting.
- They are generally not reuptaken or broken down immediately, allowing for prolonged action.
- They can amplify or diminish the effects of neurotransmitters.
- Examples: Dopamine and others like Adenosine and neuropeptide Y can also act as a neuromodulator.

## Neuropeptides

Neuropeptides are a **type of neuromodulator.** They are **small protein-like molecules (peptides) used by neurons to communicate with each other.**

### Key Features

- They are larger and more complex than conventional neurotransmitters.
- They are stored in larger dense-core vesicles, not in the smaller synaptic vesicles in which traditional neurotransmitters are stored.
- Released peptides can act at close and far distances and diffuse freely.
- They often have a slower, longer-lasting, and more widespread effect.
- Examples: Endorphins, Vasopressin, Oxytocin.

## Differences

1. **Action:** Neurotransmitters directly trigger a response in the target cell, while neuromodulators modulate or alter the target cell’s response. Neuropeptides, a type of neuromodulator, have a slower and more widespread effect.
2. **Speed and Duration:** Neurotransmitters generally work faster but their effects are more short-lived. Neuromodulators and neuropeptides have slower, longer-lasting effects.
3. **Location of Action:** Neurotransmitters generally act at the site they are released from, while neuromodulators and neuropeptides can have a more widespread influence, affecting multiple neurons at once.
