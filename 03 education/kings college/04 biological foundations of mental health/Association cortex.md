The association cortex is a **part of the cerebral cortex that is essential for complex functions like perception, cognition, and decision-making.** It combines information from different sensory modalities to create a more holistic perception of the environment.

## Key Features

- **Sensory Integration:** The association cortex is involved in the integration of sensory information from various parts of the brain. This helps us comprehensively understand our surroundings by combining different sensory modalities, such as vision, hearing, and touch.
- **High-Level Cognitive Functions:** The association cortex is crucial for high-level cognitive functions, including attention, planning, decision-making, and working memory.
- **Location:** The association cortex is not localised to one specific area but is found in all four lobes of the brain: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.

## Examples of [[Association fibres|Association]] Areas

- **Prefrontal [[Neocortex|Cortex]]:** Located in the frontal lobe, the prefrontal cortex is involved in planning complex cognitive behaviour, personality expression, decision-making, and moderating social behaviour.
- **Parietal-Temporal-Occipital Association Area:** This area integrates sensory information from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual areas to understand spatial relationships and recognise objects and faces.
- **Limbic Association Area:** This area deals with emotions, memory, and learning. It includes parts of the limbic system, which includes the hippocampus (important for memory) and the amygdala (important for emotion).
