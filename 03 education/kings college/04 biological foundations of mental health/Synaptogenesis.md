Synaptogenesis is the **formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system.** This process is fundamental to building the complex neural circuits that make up the brain.

## Key Features

- Synaptogenesis is most active during early brain development but continues throughout life as the brain changes and learns.
- A complex interplay of many different proteins and other molecules regulates the process.
