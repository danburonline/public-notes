## 1. Axodendritic Synapses

Axodendritic synapses are the **most common type in the central nervous system (CNS),** and they involve connections between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another. This allows signals to be transmitted from the neuron with the axon to the neuron with the dendrite.

## 2. Axosomatic Synapses

Axosomatic synapses involve connections between one neuron’s axon and another’s soma (cell body). These synapses can have a powerful influence on the neuron because they are closer to the neuron’s integration centre, where the decision to fire an action potential is made.

## 3. Axoaxonic Synapses

Axoaxonic synapses are less common and involve connections between one neuron’s axon and another’s axon. These synapses can control the amount of neurotransmitter released from the axon terminal, thereby modulating the strength of the signal sent to other neurons.
