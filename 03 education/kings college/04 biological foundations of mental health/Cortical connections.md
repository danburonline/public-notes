[[Cortical column|Cortical]] connections are the network of links between the neurons in the brain's cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the human brain, which is responsible for many higher-level functions such as thought, language, and information processing. The connections between neurons can be either local (connecting nearby neurons within the same cortex region) or long-range (connecting neurons in distant cortex regions).

In the context of neural connections, the terms "ascending" and "descending" refer to the direction of information flow.

- **Ascending connections**, also known as afferent connections, carry information from the peripheral nervous system (sensory input) to higher centres in the brain. These connections facilitate sensory perception, enabling the brain to understand and interpret the external world. For instance, when you touch a hot surface, the sensory neurons in your skin will send a signal through ascending connections to your brain, which interprets the signal as the sensation of heat.

- **Descending connections**, also known as efferent connections, carry information from the brain to the peripheral nervous system or to lower centres in the brain. These connections control motor functions, allowing the brain to command the body's muscles and organs. For example, if you decide to pick up a glass of water, your brain will send a signal through descending connections to the muscles in your arm and hand, causing them to perform the necessary movements.
