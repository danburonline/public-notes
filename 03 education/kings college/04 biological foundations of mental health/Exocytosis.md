Exocytosis is a central process in neurons that allows communication between cells in the brain and the rest of the body. It is the **mechanism by which neurons release neurotransmitters to send signals to other neurons.**

## The [[Types of synapses|Synapse]]

A synapse is a junction between two neurons. It consists of:

- **Presynaptic Neuron:** The neuron that sends the signal.
- **Synaptic Cleft:** The gap between the two neurons.
- **Postsynaptic Neuron:** The neuron that receives the signal.

Neurotransmitters released from the presynaptic neuron traverse the synaptic cleft to bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, initiating a new signal in the latter.

## Steps in [[Pre- and post-synaptic|Synaptic]] Exocytosis

1. **Vesicle Trafficking:** The neurotransmitter-filled vesicles are moved towards the presynaptic membrane.
2. **Vesicle Docking:** The vesicles are anchored to the presynaptic membrane by proteins such as SNAREs (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor).
3. **Vesicle Priming:** The vesicles are made ready for fusion. This involves the SNARE complex, which includes proteins like syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane, and synaptobrevin on the vesicle membrane.
4. **Action [[Graded potential|Potential]] Arrival:** The arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal triggers the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels.
5. **Calcium Influx:** Calcium ions flow into the neuron. Their increase in the cell’s cytoplasm triggers vesicle fusion.
6. **Vesicle Fusion:** The vesicle and plasma membranes merge, forming a fusion pore through which neurotransmitters can be released.
7. **Neurotransmitter Release:** The neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, from where they can bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

## Key Points in Neurotransmitter Release

- **Calcium Dependence:** The fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is dependent on the influx of calcium ions. This makes the release of neurotransmitters a regulated process, sensitive to the arrival of an action potential.
- **Vesicle Recycling:** After neurotransmitter release, the vesicle membrane is retrieved from the plasma membrane and recycled to form new vesicles in a process called endocytosis.
- **Quantal Release:** Neurotransmitters are released in discrete packets or “quanta”, each from a single vesicle.
