Feature detectors are neurons in the visual cortex that respond to specific features of visual stimuli, such as edges, lines, angles, and movement. These detectors are organised in a hierarchical manner, with simple cells detecting basic features and complex cells detecting more complex features. The responses of these feature detectors are then combined to form a representation of the visual scene that can be used for perception and action.
