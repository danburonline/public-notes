In the context of neuroscience, online rehearsal refers to **the active mental or cognitive process of practising or rehearsing information in real-time during the learning or encoding phase.** It involves repeatedly engaging with newly acquired knowledge or skills through mental repetition, elaboration, or visualisation. Online rehearsal is believed to strengthen neural connections and promote long-term memory formation.
