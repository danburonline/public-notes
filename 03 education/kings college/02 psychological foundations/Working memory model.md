This model was **proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974** and is mainly focused on short-term memory. It consists of three components: **the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad.**

The **central executive is the main component of this model and is responsible for controlling and coordinating the other two components.** The phonological loop is responsible for storing and rehearsing verbal information, while the visuospatial sketchpad is responsible for storing and manipulating visual information. This model has been used to explain how people process and store information and is a useful tool for understanding cognitive processes.
