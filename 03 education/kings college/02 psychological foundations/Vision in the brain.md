1. **Light Enters the Eye**: Vision begins when light enters the eye by passing through the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, which helps to focus the light.

2. **Pupil and Iris Adjustment**: The light then enters the pupil, the black part in the centre of the eye. The iris (the coloured part of the eye) adjusts to control the amount of light that gets through to the lens. In low light conditions, the iris widens to let in more light; in bright light, it narrows to let in less light.

3. **Lens Focus**: The lens, located behind the iris, further focuses the light onto the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.

4. **Photoreceptors and the Fovea**: Light that reaches the retina triggers a reaction in two types of cells: rods, which detect light and dark, and cones, which detect colour. These cells are spread across the retina, but there’s a high concentration of cones in the fovea, the centre of the retina. This region provides the clearest, most detailed vision.

5. **Conversion to Electric Signals**: The photoreceptors in the retina convert the light into electrical signals. This process is called phototransduction.

6. **Transmission to the Optic Nerve**: The electrical signals are sent to different layers of cells within the retina, finally reaching the ganglion cells. The axons of the ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries the visual information from the eye to the brain.

7. **Crossing at the Optic Chiasm**: The optic nerves from both eyes meet at the optic chiasm. About half of the nerve fibres cross over to the other side of the brain. This means that each half of the brain receives visual information from both eyes, which allows for depth perception.

8. **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)**: The optic nerve sends signals to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a relay centre in the thalamus, the part of the brain that serves as a hub for sensory information. The LGN has six layers, and information from each eye is sent to separate layers.

9. **Primary Visual Cortex (V1)**: From the LGN, the signals travel along the optic radiations to reach the primary visual cortex, also known as V1 or Brodmann area 17, at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe. Here, the signals begin to be decoded into visual perception.

10. **Further Processing**: From V1, the visual information is sent to other parts of the visual cortex for further processing. The dorsal stream (or “where” pathway) analyses motion and spatial relationships, while the ventral stream (or “what” pathway) interprets characteristics like colour and shape.
