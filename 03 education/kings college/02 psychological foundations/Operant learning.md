Operant learning, also known as operant conditioning, is a type of learning in which an individualâ€™s behaviour is modified through the consequences (rewards or punishments) that follow it. This type of learning was first described by psychologist B.F. Skinner and is based on the idea that behaviours can be strengthened or weakened based on the outcomes that follow them.
