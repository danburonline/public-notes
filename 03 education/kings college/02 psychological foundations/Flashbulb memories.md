Flashbulb memories are **detailed and vivid “snapshot” memories of momentous or emotionally charged events.** They are named “flashbulbs” because they seem to capture the situation in which they were learned as if it were illuminated by a camera’s flash.

## Key Features

1. **Detail and Vividity:** Flashbulb memories are often highly detailed and vivid, including aspects such as where you were, what you were doing, and who you were with when you learned of the event.
2. **Emotional Charge:** These memories often form in response to unexpected and emotionally powerful events. Examples include hearing about major news events like 9/11 or personal events such as a family member’s death.

**Accuracy and Stability:**
While flashbulb memories are subjectively vivid and detailed, research suggests they aren’t always perfectly accurate and can change over time. This is due to factors such as narrative rehearsal (retelling the memory), which can introduce errors, and memory consolidation processes, which can modify the memory.

**Use in Research:**
Flashbulb memories provide valuable insights for researchers studying memory and emotion, shedding light on how emotion can enhance memory, how memory errors can occur, and how personal experiences interact with collective memory (e.g., societal memories of major events).

**Real-World Application:**
Flashbulb memories are used in areas like eyewitness testimony (e.g., understanding memory errors) and therapy (e.g., working with vivid traumatic memories).
