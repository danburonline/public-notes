Radical behaviourism is a philosophy and theoretical framework for analysing human and animal behaviour. It emphasises the role of **environmental factors in shaping behaviour and rejects using mentalistic concepts such as "thoughts" and "feelings"** to explain behaviour. Radical behaviourism is associated with the work of B.F. [[The operant chamber (Skinner box)|Skinner]] and his followers and is often contrasted with cognitive and psychoanalytic approaches to psychology.
