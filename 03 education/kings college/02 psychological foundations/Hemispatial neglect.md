Hemispatial neglect, **also known as unilateral neglect,** is a neurological disorder characterised by a person’s inability to attend to or be aware of stimuli on one side of their visual field, typically the left side. Individuals with hemispatial neglect often appear as if they are completely ignoring or neglecting the affected side. Here are key points to remember:

1. **Symptoms:** People with hemispatial neglect may have difficulty with activities such as dressing, eating, or reading because they neglect one side of the body or vision. They may bump into objects on the neglected side, only eat food from one side of the plate, or ignore words on the neglected side of a page.
2. **Causes:** Hemispatial neglect is frequently associated with damage to the brain’s right hemisphere, particularly the parietal lobe. It commonly occurs after strokes or other brain injuries. However, it’s important to note that neglect can occur on the left side following damage to the right hemisphere or even on the right side in very rare cases.
3. **Assessment:** Various tests and assessments, such as line bisection tasks or cancellation tasks, are used to diagnose and evaluate the severity of hemispatial neglect.
4. **Treatment:** Treatment strategies for hemispatial neglect aim to improve the person’s awareness and attention to the neglected side. Techniques include visual scanning exercises, limb activation, and environmental modifications to encourage exploration of the neglected space. Occupational therapy and visual-spatial rehabilitation programs are commonly used.
5. **Compensation Strategies:** Individuals with hemispatial neglect can learn compensatory strategies to improve their functional abilities. These may involve techniques like turning their head to scan the environment, using visual cues to prompt attention to the neglected side, or using adaptive devices to aid daily activities.
