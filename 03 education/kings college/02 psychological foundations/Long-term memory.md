Long Term Memory (LTM) is an extensive memory storage system that can **hold information for prolonged periods, ranging from a few minutes to a lifetime.** It is divided into two broad categories: Explicit Memory (or Declarative Memory) and Implicit Memory (or Nondeclarative Memory).

## Explicit Memory (Declarative Memory)

Explicit memory, also known as declarative memory, is a type of long-term memory that requires conscious thought. It involves memories that can be consciously and intentionally recalled, and these memories are often based on facts (semantic memory) or personal experiences (episodic memory).

### Semantic Memory

Semantic memory is a sub-category of declarative memory that includes general knowledge about the world, independent of personal experience. This includes facts, concepts, ideas, and vocabulary. For example, knowing that Paris is the capital of France is a piece of semantic memory. The process of creating semantic memory is sometimes referred to as “semantic encoding”.

### Episodic Memory

Episodic memory, another sub-category of declarative memory, involves the recollection of specific events, situations, and experiences. These memories are personally experienced events that occur in a particular place at a specific time. For example, remembering your last vacation trip to Paris is episodic.

## Implicit Memory (Nondeclarative Memory)

Implicit memory, also known as nondeclarative memory, is a type of long-term memory that is not consciously controlled. It is acquired and used unconsciously and can influence thoughts and behaviours without the person’s awareness. This type of memory primarily involves skills and routine procedures that are performed automatically.

Implicit memories are typically acquired through repetition and practice and are manifested in our skills and habits. They can be divided into several types: procedural memory, priming, classical conditioning, and habituation.

### Procedural Memory

Procedural memory is a sub-type of implicit memory that involves the memory of how to perform different actions and skills. Essentially, it is the memory of how to do certain things. Riding a bike, typing on a keyboard, tying a shoe, or driving a car are all examples of procedural memories. These are often motor skills that we perform automatically, without conscious thought.

### Perceptual Memory

Perceptual memory refers to the ability to recognise or recall objects, items, or patterns, often based on sensory experience. For example, being able to identify a song based on a few notes or recognising a painting style is a form of perceptual memory.
