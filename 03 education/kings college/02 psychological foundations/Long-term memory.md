Long Term [[Working memory model|Memory]] (LTM) is divided into two types: Explicit [[Working memory model|Memory]] and Implicit Memory.

## Explicit Memory

Explicit memory can be recalled and **accessed through conscious efforts,** such as facts, events, and experiences. It is also known as declarative memory.

## Implicit Memory

Implicit memory is **unconscious memory acquired through repetition and practice** and is not consciously accessible. It is also known as procedural memory. Examples of implicit memory include motor skills, habits, and emotional reactions.
