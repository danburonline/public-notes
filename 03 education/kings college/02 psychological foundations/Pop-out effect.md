2. **Feature Singularity:** It’s driven by a unique feature of an object, such as colour, shape, or motion, that differentiates it from its surroundings.

**Usage in Research:**
The pop-out effect is used in studying various topics, like attention and visual perception. It helps us understand how humans process complex visual scenes and prioritise information.

Examples of the pop-out effect can be found in daily life, such as a red apple among green ones or a flashing emergency light in traffic.
