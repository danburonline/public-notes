In fMRI, image quality is affected by the balance between spatial and temporal resolution. Spatial resolution allows for better identification of specific brain regions, while temporal resolution allows for tracking changes in brain activity over time. Higher resolution in both areas leads to more accurate and detailed fMRI images.
