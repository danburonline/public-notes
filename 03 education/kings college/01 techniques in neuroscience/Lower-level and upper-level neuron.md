Upper motor neurons are nerve cells in the brain that control voluntary movements and muscle tone, and lower motor neurons are nerve cells in the spinal cord that control the contraction of muscles. Upper motor neurons send signals to lower motor neurons to initiate movement, and lower motor neurons use that information to control the contraction of muscles and maintain muscle tone.
