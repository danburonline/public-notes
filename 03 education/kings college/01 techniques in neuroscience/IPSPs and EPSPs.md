## IPSPs

- Inhibitory signals that hyperpolarise (make more negative) the membrane potential, reducing the likelihood of firing an action potential

## EPSPs

- Excitatory signals that depolarise (make more positive) the membrane potential, increasing the likelihood of firing an action potential
- Occur at the postsynaptic membrane of a neuron after the release of neurotransmitter from a presynaptic neuron
- Regulate neural activity and communication between neuron
