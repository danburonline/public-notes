## 1. Narrative Reviews

- **Description**: Also known as traditional reviews, these provide a comprehensive overview of a topic or issue. They summarise and critique a wide range of literature but do not follow a strict systematic approach.
- **Purpose**: To provide a broad perspective on a topic, identify gaps, and highlight key findings and theoretical developments.
- **Methodology**: Qualitative, often unsystematic, relying on the authorâ€™s expertise and judgment.

## 2. Qualitative Systematic Reviews

- **Description**: These reviews focus on synthesising qualitative research studies. They aim to integrate findings from multiple qualitative studies to draw comprehensive conclusions.
- **Purpose**: To gather in-depth insights and identify patterns and themes across qualitative studies.
- **Methodology**: Systematic and transparent methods, including predefined criteria for study inclusion, rigorous search strategies, and qualitative synthesis techniques like thematic analysis or meta-ethnography.

## 3. Quantitative Systematic Reviews

- **Description**: These reviews systematically collect and analyse quantitative research studies. They often involve statistical techniques to aggregate and analyse data.
- **Purpose**: To provide an objective and precise estimate of the effect size or relationship between variables across multiple studies.
- **Methodology**: Systematic search, selection of studies based on predefined criteria, and quantitative synthesis methods like meta-analysis.

## Other Types of Reviews

### 4. Scoping Reviews

- **Description**: Aim to map the key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in research related to a specific topic.
- **Purpose**: To provide an overview of the existing literature, identify research gaps, and inform future research directions.
- **Methodology**: Systematic but less stringent than systematic reviews, often including various study designs and sources of evidence.

### 5. Integrative Reviews

- **Description**: Integrate findings from diverse methodologies (both qualitative and quantitative) to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena.
- **Purpose**: To synthesise diverse forms of evidence to generate new frameworks and perspectives.
- **Methodology**: Flexible, combining systematic and narrative review approaches.

### 6. Rapid Reviews

- **Description**: Provide a quick, structured synthesis of available evidence, often used to inform urgent decision-making.
- **Purpose**: To quickly inform policy or practice by summarising the best available evidence.
- **Methodology**: Streamlined systematic review methods, often with simplified search and appraisal processes.

### 7. Umbrella Reviews

- **Description**: Synthesise findings from multiple systematic reviews on a broad topic.
- **Purpose**: To provide a high-level summary of evidence from several systematic reviews.
- **Methodology**: Systematic, often involving a critical appraisal of the included systematic reviews.
