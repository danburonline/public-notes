Mind blanking is a **mental state where an individual experiences a temporary lapse in mental content.** This means that while they are awake, they are not thinking about anything specific. This state is different from mind wandering, where the mind drifts to various thoughts unrelated to the current task at hand.

## Causes and Occurrences

Mind blanking can occur spontaneously and is often linked to:
- **Low Engagement**: When a person is not particularly interested in or focused on a task.
- **Tiredness**: Fatigue from a long day or lack of sleep.
- **[[Stress]] and Anxiety**: High levels of [[stress]] or anxiety can trigger episodes of mind blanking.

## Neuroscientific Insights

Research indicates that mind blanking is associated with specific brain activities:
- **Slow Brain Waves**: Typically observed during sleep, these waves can intrude into wakefulness, leading to attentional lapses and mind blanking.
- **Global Positive Connectivity**: During mind blanking, there is a higher global signal amplitude in the brain, indicating a distinct physiological state.
