## Active Electrodes

- **Definition**: Active electrodes have built-in amplifiers that boost the EEG signal at the site of measurement, which reduces the amount of electrical noise that is picked up as the signal travels along the cable to the main amplifier.
- **Benefits**: They enhance signal quality by improving the signal-to-noise ratio, making them less susceptible to interference from environmental sources, such as powerline noise.
- **Usage**: Often used in research settings and complex EEG studies to obtain clearer signals and more accurate readings.

## Non-Active Electrodes

- **Definition**: Non-active electrodes do not have built-in amplifiers. The EEG signals are picked up by the electrode and then transmitted via wires to the amplifier, which is usually some distance away from the electrode.
- **Challenges**: More susceptible to noise, including powerline (50 or 60 Hz) interference, because the signal has to travel a longer distance without amplification, making it more vulnerable to external electric fields.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in clinical settings due to their simplicity and lower cost compared to active electrodes.
