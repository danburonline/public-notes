Double dipping in exploratory analysis refers to **the practice of using the same dataset for both selecting variables and performing subsequent analyses.** It can lead to biased results and invalid statistical inferences. Double dipping, also known as circular analysis, can occur when researchers explore the same data multiple times, potentially inflating the likelihood of finding false associations or patterns. It is recommended to avoid double dipping by using independent datasets for variable selection and analysis.
