Event-related potentials (ERPs) are **measured brain responses that are the direct result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event.** These potentials can be extracted from the ongoing electroencephalography (EEG) data by averaging the signal time-locked to the onset of stimuli or responses.

## Characteristics of ERPs

- **Components**: ERPs consist of multiple waves, typically characterised by their polarity (positive or negative) and the time at which they occur after the stimulus (in milliseconds).
- **Measurement**: ERPs are measured by placing electrodes at various points on the scalp, with the international 10-20 system being the most common arrangement for electrode placement.
- **Analysis**: The data is averaged over many trials to reduce noise and enhance the signal related to the event, allowing researchers to observe the typical response to a given stimulus.

## Application of ERPs

- **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Used to study cognitive processes such as attention, perception, and memory.
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Helpful in diagnosing various neurological conditions, including sleep disorders, cognitive decline, and developmental disorders.
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**: Employed in the development of BCIs for communication and control by decoding user intentions from their brainwaves.

## Interpretation of ERP Distribution

- **Scalp Distribution**: The distribution of ERPs across the scalp provides information about the neural sources of the recorded potentials. Different brain regions are associated with different cognitive functions, and thus, the ERP distribution can inform about the underlying processes.
- **Amplitude and Latency**: The amplitude of an ERP component represents the strength of the neural response, while the latency indicates the timing of neural processes.

> [!example] Example of ERP Distribution across the Scalp
> - **P300**: A positive wave that occurs around 300ms after stimulus onset, commonly associated with attention and working memory processes.
> - **N400**: A negative deflection peaking around 400ms, typically linked to semantic processing and language comprehension.
>  - **Mismatch Negativity (MMN)**: Reflects automatic detection of change in auditory stimuli.
