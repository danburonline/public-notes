The neuronal arterial network refers to **blood vessels that supply blood to the brainâ€™s neural tissue.** This network is crucial for maintaining the health and functionality of the brain, as it ensures a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products.

Key components of this network include:

- **Cerebral Arteries**: These are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. They include the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries supplying different brain regions.
- **Capillary Networks**: These are fine, branching blood vessels that extend from the cerebral arteries. They are responsible for directly exchanging nutrients and waste between the blood and the brain tissue.
- **Venous Drainage**: After circulating through the brain, blood is collected in veins and venous sinuses, which eventually return it to the heart.
