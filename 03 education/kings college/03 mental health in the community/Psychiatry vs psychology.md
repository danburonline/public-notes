## Psychiatry

Psychiatrists are medical doctors (MD or DO) who specialise in mental health, including substance use disorders. They are equipped to understand the complex relationships between mental and physical health. Psychiatrists can diagnose and treat mental health disorders and provide psychological therapy. Importantly, as physicians, they can also prescribe medication.

**Example:** Let’s say a person suffers from severe depression to the point where it significantly impacts their daily life. They experience loss of appetite, consistent low mood, and suicidal thoughts. They go to a psychiatrist, who diagnoses them with Major Depressive [[Mental disorders overview|Disorder]]. The psychiatrist might prescribe a type of medication like an antidepressant and may also suggest [[Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] to help the patient cope with their feelings. The psychiatrist can provide and monitor the effects of medication, adjusting the dosage or changing the medication as needed.

## Psychology

Psychologists, on the other hand, have an advanced degree in psychology (PhD or PsyD) but are not typically medical doctors. Psychologists focus on the human mind and human behaviour, and their education emphasises psychometric testing, psychotherapy, research methods, and statistical analysis. Psychologists can administer psychological tests, conduct research, and provide therapy. In some jurisdictions, psychologists can get additional training to prescribe medications, but this is not the norm.

**Example:** Suppose a person is dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety because of their job. They decide to see a psychologist, who helps them understand and cope with their stress and anxiety through techniques like cognitive-behavioural therapy or mindfulness. The psychologist may also use various psychological tests to help understand the person’s condition better.
