Copy number variation (CNV) is a **phenomenon in which genome sections are repeated, and the number of repeats varies between individuals.** It is a type of structural variation that involves duplications or deletions of a significant number of base pairs in the genome.

Copy number variations can encompass a large portion of the genome, with approximately two-thirds of the human genome consisting of repeats. They play a role in generating genetic variation in populations and can also contribute to disease phenotypes. CNVs can be classified into short repeats, such as dinucleotide and trinucleotide, and long repeats, including repeats of entire genes.
