[[Synaptic plasticity|Synaptic]] gain refers to the **strength or efficacy of a synapse in transmitting signals from one neuron to another.** This concept is crucial because it influences how easily and to what extent a neuron can influence the activity of another neuron. Synaptic gain is determined by various factors, including:

1. **Neurotransmitter [[Exocytosis#Key Points in Neurotransmitter Release|Release]]:** The amount and type of neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft can affect synaptic gain. Higher amounts of neurotransmitter release typically increase synaptic gain.
2. **Receptor Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron to the neurotransmitter also plays a role. Higher sensitivity usually leads to increased synaptic gain.
3. [[Types of synapses|Synapse]] Structure:** The physical structure of the synapse, such as the synaptic cleft’s size and the receptors’ density, can influence synaptic gain.
4. **Modulatory Inputs:** Other neurons can modulate synaptic gain through various mechanisms, such as releasing neuromodulators that affect the release of neurotransmitters or the sensitivity of receptors.
5. **Plasticity [[Neuron transport mechanisms|Mechanisms]]:** [[Activity-dependent plasticity#Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)|Long-term]] changes in synaptic strength, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), can lead to sustained increases or decreases in synaptic gain. These changes are often associated with learning and memory.
