Interneurons, or sometimes also called association neurons, are central nervous system **neurons located between sensory and motor pathways.** They are pivotal in processing and relaying information, serving as critical components in neural circuits that mediate reflexes, motor coordination, and higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory.

## Characteristics

- **Location**: Predominantly found in the brain and spinal cord.
- **Structure**: Exhibits a variety of shapes and sizes, often characterised by complex dendritic trees and axonal arborisation.
- **Functionality**: Primarily involved in signal integration, modulation, and synchronisation. They can either be excitatory, releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate, or inhibitory, releasing neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine.
- **Diversity**: Encompasses various subtypes, each with unique morphological, electrophysiological, and biochemical properties. This diversity allows for a wide range of functional roles within neural networks.

## Functional Roles

1. **Signal Integration**: Interneurons integrate signals from multiple sources, contributing to the complex processing capabilities of neural circuits.
2. **Network Oscillations**: Play a crucial role in generating rhythmic activity patterns essential for various physiological processes, including locomotion and cognitive functions.
3. **Synaptic [[Synaptic plasticity|Plasticity]]**: Involved in modulating synaptic strength, which is fundamental to learning and memory.
4. **Feedback Inhibition**: Provide negative feedback to neural circuits, helping to regulate and refine signal flow, ensuring balanced and precise output.

## Clinical Significance

- **Neurological [[Peripheral nervous system#Diseases and Disorders|Disorders]]**: Abnormalities in interneuron function and connectivity are implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders.
- **Therapeutic Targets**: Due to their central role in modulating neural circuitry, interneurons present potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring normal neural function in disease states.
