Yamanaka factors are a set of **four transcription factors that have the ability to reprogram differentiated adult cells into pluripotent stem cells.** This groundbreaking discovery was made by Shinya Yamanaka and his team, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in [[Electrophysiology measurements|Physiology]] or [[Personalised regenerative medicine|Medicine]] in 2012. These factors are critical for inducing pluripotency, which is the ability of a cell to develop into any cell in the body.

## The Four Factors

- **Oct3/4 (POU5F1)**: A transcription factor pivotal for the self-renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
- **Sox2**: Another transcription factor that works closely with Oct3/4. It is also essential for maintaining self-renewal.
- **Klf4**: Contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency but can also be involved in regulating cell differentiation.
- **c-Myc**: Known to regulate cell growth and apoptosis, it plays a role in cellular reprogramming and the proliferation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
