Runaway excitation is a **pathological condition in neural networks with an excessive and uncontrolled increase in neuronal activity.** This hyperactivity can lead to a variety of neurological consequences and is often associated with seizure disorders. Runaway excitation occurs when the normal regulatory mechanisms of neuronal firing fail. It can result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals within the brain. This imbalance may be due to excess excitatory neurotransmitters or a deficiency in inhibitory neurotransmitters.

## Mechanisms

### Excessive Excitatory Neurotransmission

- An overabundance of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate can lead to increased neuronal firing.

### Inadequate Inhibition

- A lack of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA can fail to counterbalance excitation.

### Ion [[Ion channels|Channel]] Dysfunction

- Abnormal function of ion channels, especially those regulating calcium and sodium ions, can contribute to increased excitatory potential.

## Consequences

- **Neuronal Damage**: Prolonged periods of runaway excitation can lead to neuronal injury or death due to excitotoxicity.
- **Seizures**: Runaway excitation is a key feature of seizure activity, where there is a sudden burst of electrical activity in the brain.
- **Neurological Disorders**: Conditions such as epilepsy, migraines, and certain psychiatric disorders may involve runaway excitation.
