A cortical column is the basic functional unit of the [[Neocortex]], the outermost layer of the brain, which is responsible for higher brain functions such as perception, attention, and learning. It consists of a group of neurons arranged in a cylindrical shape, with vertical layers of specific cell types and connections.
